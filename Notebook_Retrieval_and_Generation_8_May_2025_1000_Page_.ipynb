However, productivity in both countries has steadily increased. Top 100 U.S. universities produced 7,957 articles in the 2014-2018 reporting period, compared to 5,359 articles in the inaugural 2000-2004 period. The number of articles from Canadian universities in the Top 100 has gone from 207 articles in 2005 to 545 in 2019.\\nThe number of publications by Top 100 universities from countries outside North America has increased from 538 in 2005 to 2,489 in 2019. China has led the way by increasing from 155 articles in 2005 to 647 in 2019.\\n“Being able to analyze productivity by country is an interesting facet of the UT Dallas Top 100 Business School Research Rankings,” saidDr. Hasan Pirkul, Caruth Chair and Jindal School dean. “To see international universities gaining on American schools speaks to global competitiveness and puts us on notice to stay on our toes.”\\nIn the 2014-2018 reporting period, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania was the most productive university, as it has been since the inception of the rankings.\\nThe Leonard N. Stern Business School at New York University climbed from No. 3 to No. 2 in the Worldwide Rankings. NYU moved ahead of Harvard Business School, which had occupied the No. 2 position since the 2012 report. That year, NYU was No. 6.\\nThe Jindal School and Columbia Business School rounded out the top five in both North American and Worldwide Rankings, coming in at No. 4 and No. 5, respectively.\\nSpeaking about the latest rankings, Pirkul said he sees the UT Dallas Top 100 as a valuable benchmarking tool for business leaders and academics. He said that top academics are drawn to hubs of research productivity. “So rankings can be a valuable faculty-recruiting tool,” he said.\\n“A cycle of faculty recruitment and corporate engagement helps to strengthen a business school’s programs, which helps it produce graduates who are well-prepared to provide real value to the corporations that hire them,” he said.\\nThe Carey Business School at John Hopkins University made the biggest jump in the rankings since last year, moving from No. 100 to No. 86 in the Worldwide Rankings.\\nFrance’s INSEAD was the top school outside North America in the Worldwide Rankings, coming in at No. 6. The next school outside North America in those rankings was the University of London’s London Business School, which came in at No. 21.\\nThe United Kingdom and Canada each had six schools on the worldwide list, followed by Singapore with three.

Podcast\\nbyJeanne Spreier- April 4th, 2017 -Alumni,Events\\nMore than 80 University of Texas at Dallas alumni gathered at New York City’s Park Avenue Tavern in March — mostly reveling in the fact that so many UT Dallas alumni live and work in the Big Apple.\\nAbout three-quarters of the attendees to the midtown Manhattan happy hour were Naveen Jindal School of Management alumni.\\nThe most frequently heard comment was “thank you for doing this,” said Brittany Huber, JSOM director for development and alumni relations, who attended the event. “Most of them were surprised there were so many UT Dallas alums in the city. A lot of them didn’t even realize we have a full UT Dallas alumni chapter in New York City.”\\nAmong the pleasant surprises — two alumni who both work for Verizon but didn’t realize they both graduated from UT Dallas until they showed up at the venue.\\n“In New York City, people tend to look for their pack,” says Jack Sun, BS’02, CEO of Sino Garden International Development Corp., which is based in the New York-New Jersey area. “A local alumni network provides resources, connections and mutual benefits.”\\nThe New York City alumni chapter was established byMatthew Thompson, BS’12, shortly after he moved there. Thompson, who landed in the area after earning his marketing degree, worked for marketing agencies before joining Accenture as a consultant.\\nRegional alumni chapters are easy to establish, especially now withJindalConnect, which allows fellow Comets to search for alumni by location. Thelist of existing university chaptersis limited, so the opportunities are large to form a new chapter. Therequirementsfor setting up a chapter are brief, and Jasmine Carter, the Jindal School’s director of alumni relations, is happy to assist.\\n“We love to reconnect with our Comets and help them grow their networks in their own cities,” Carter says.\\nView all posts by Jeanne Spreier\\nMore from Alumni - News Category\\nJindal School Alumnus Creates Innovative Solution for Chronic-Pain Management\\nJindal School Alumni Reunion: More Than 700 Alumni Gather for Fun and Connections\\nDipak Jain Named as Jindal School’s Inaugural Eminent PhD Alumnus\\nA dog-eared letter dated April 7, 1982, is so important to Dr. Dipak C.

              "  'chunks': ['Panel Discussion at Jindal School Focuses on Neurodiversity at Work\\nAlumni Spotlights\\nTestimonials\\nNewsletters\\nG.O.A.T. Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- April 30th, 2024 -Events\\nIn celebration of World Autism Month, theNaveen Jindal School of Managementpresented “Neurodiversity at Work: The Employee Experience,” an April 19 panel discussion featuring representatives from companies that offer special programs and accommodations for neurodivergent employees, as well as employees who described their experiences of working with a neurodivergence.\\nThe panel consisted of Geoffrey Barker, MBA’23, a senior analyst, advanced product strategy at Toyota Motor North America; Connor Brady, a technical operations manager at Amazon Web Services; Nyamusi Lee, executive director and head of the Global Autism At Work program at JPMorgan Chase & Co.; and Christian Bugslag, a senior consultant at Fujitsu Canada, who joined virtually.\\nDr. Monica Powell, senior associate dean at the Jindal School, opened the discussion by welcoming the audience.\\n“Don’t be afraid to be different; be afraid to be the same,” she said. “And I just think that is so important — that whoever you are and whatever you bring to the table, you can find success and that’s an opportunity for you to do something unique and to really catalyze whatever that skill is that you bring. These are important topics.”\\nDr. Maria Hasenhuttl, MBA’95, PhD’08, an associate professor of instruction and assistant area coordinator in theOrganizations, Strategy and International Management Areaat the Jindal School, served as the moderator. She set the stage by explaining that neurodiversity is “about the natural variances in the brain which results in different ways of thinking, learning and socializing.”\\nBarker, who has ADHD, was asked how his neurodivergence has contributed to his success. He replied that his is his “superpower” and “a skill to be leveraged. Not every neuro-atypical situation is a one size fits all.”\\nHe said he had worked on a supply-chain project that required technological knowledge. Although he had little at the time, his team had been tasked with providing a solution to track the delivery of COVID-19 response kits in real time.\\n“They were having issues with the purchase-order numbers and they couldn’t figure out why,” he said. “Because I have ADHD and I won’t let anything go, I just kept after this Excel sheet.”\\nHe said he worked on it day-in and day-out, working 12-hours days until he solved it, which saved the customer lots of money.\\nBugslag shared a pivotal moment in his career as a neurodivergent (ADHD) employee. When he moved to remote work when the Covid-19 pandemic began, he went from working 40-hours a week to 80-hours.\\n“I couldn’t pull away from work,” he said. “Part of it was because I was right there and I had never worked remotely before.”\\nHe said that with remote work becoming more prevalent, it can be difficult for workers to separate their work and personal lives.\\n“I had to find strategies that let me disconnect from being at work,” he said. “I used to cycle into work so in the mornings I would take a bike ride and that was part of my ‘getting to work.’ And the same thing at the end of my workday as well as creating a separate space that was closed.”\\nOnce he created a rhythm and a boundary from which he could recognize the end of his workday, he was able to restore a better balance to his life.\\nBrady, whose company sponsored the event by providing food and drinks, shared an experience in which he saw for the first time a positive result from implementing an inclusive corporate hiring strategy. A candidate for employment had asked for accommodation during an interview. She said that she was neurodivergent and had trouble maintaining her energy during long periods of verbal communication. Since that was not a primary requirement of the role, they offered to allow her to type her answers to their interview questions.\\n“Being able to have that group setting where everybody came together and understood this going into the interview, it made a [positive] experience,” he said. “We got the data we needed about the candidate, we were able to make the hiring decision the same way — and it wasn’t this strange thing that suddenly started happening during the course of the interview.”\\nLee said that celebrating Autism Inclusion Month at her company has actually changed the bank’s culture. At their Global Inclusion event, three senior leaders disclosed that they had received autism diagnoses at a late stage in life, as adults.\\n“We’ve seen that coming through,” she said, “to where we’ve created that safe space, that conducive and supportive environment.”\\nHasenhuttl said it is important for the Jindal School to take the lead in North Texas and get involved in creating and supporting opportunities for its neurodivergent students, graduates, and others in the community because studies show that a high percentage of neurodivergent people, even if they are college graduates, are unemployed.\\n“This is a huge waste of human potential, and it deprives so many people of the opportunity to contribute to society and experience the dignity of work, which is No. 8 of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals — full employment and decent work for all,” she said.\\nHasenhuttl said many companies and organizations have recognized this need and are working to create opportunities for neurodivergent people.\\n“In the Jindal School, we contribute to thought leadership in management education and practice,” she said. “This commitment includes focusing on the strengths and challenges of neurodivergent individuals, responding to evolving societal changes.”\\nDr. Dorothée Honhon, associate dean for sustainability and societal impact and a professor in theOperations Management Areaat the Jindal School, said she hopes that events like this one help raise awareness of neurodiversity and change the vocabulary people use: away from terms like “disability” or even “condition” to talking about “differences in how the brain operates” and “strengths.”\\n“I hope the event helped people recognize that, like all forms of diversity, neurodiversity among employees brings richness to a work environment, as there is a wider range of ways to think and approach problems and everyone can contribute with their own skills,” she said. “With any kind of difference, people who don’t know are always uneasy at first, sometimes rude and mean in their approach. I hope that this event — and future ones like it — help foster more empathy and support for all.”']},\n",

These professors add new layers of depth to the UTD team as accomplished researchers and engaging instructors. Among the new faces at the Jindal School of Management is assistant professor Dr. Jennifer Lee who specializes in Strategic Management research.\\nFor her undergraduate degree, professor Lee attended Northwestern University, finishing in 2010. Moving on to the University of Southern California where she majored in Economics, professor Lee completed her master’s degree in 2012. She earned her Ph.D. in Strategic Management at Michigan State University this past Spring of 2022.\\nHer research interests include corporate governance, shareholder activism, and temporal orientation. Her work has appeared in academic publications such as Strategic Management Journal.\\nSince UTD is one of the top schools for research in Strategic Management, professor Lee felt that the opportunity to become an assistant professor at Jindal was an incredibly attractive prospect. In addition to the wealth of resources offered to her on campus, professor Lee was intrigued by the idea of a potential move to Dallas. As a rapidly growing central hub, the DFW area presents unique opportunities to business school researchers like herself. Professor Lee views being accepted into the UTD faculty as one of her great professional accomplishments, and she looks forward to even more successes with the school in the future.\\nProfessor Lee began work on the UTD campus on August 1st. In addition to her research on corporate governance, she will begin teaching Business Policy and Strategy classes to undergraduates in the Spring Semester.\\nBeyond the classroom, professor Lee enjoys active hobbies like tennis, yoga, and scuba diving. This past summer, she went adventuring across Europe with her beloved, and now well-traveled, small white dog.  professor Lee regarded coming to UTD as a dream come true, and the staff and faculty at the Jindal School of Management are just as thrilled to have her with them on campus.\\nStrategy and International Management\\nView all posts by Varghese Jacob\\nMore from Business School - Blog Category\\nStudent Spotlight: Anthony Chu\\nAnthony Chu is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and he is expected to graduate Dec. 2026.\\nStudent Spotlight: Dena Aljabari\\nDena Aljabari is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and Analytics and she is expected to graduate May 2025.\\nStudent Spotlight: Nnamdi Edeoga\\nNnamdi Edeoga is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management and is expected to graduate in May 2025.\\n5 Reasons to Study Risk Management and Cyber Security at UT Dallas\\nAn understanding of risk management and cybersecurity can help individuals create resilient businesses that can stand the test of potential threats.\\nStudent Spotlight: Madison Hill\\nMadison Hill is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management and a Bachelor of Science in Finance double-major and she is expected to graduate May 2026.']},\n",

              "  'chunks': [\"The company had to be entirely restructured during the spinoff and at the same time tackle layoffs, Young said. The financial market in 2008 was probably the worst time to go public, he said. “Our stock went from $25 a share in May 2008 to $12.50 in October of the same year. We went from $3 billion to $18 million [in market capitalization]…However, we put a team together, and not only survived but thrived.”\\nUnderstandably, keeping everyone motivated during this time was not easy. Confronting the messiness of change, is how Solomon describes it, in his new book, Translate Motivate Activate: A Leader’s Guide to Mobilizing Change (Dallas: Brown Books Publishing Group, 2016) Mobilizing leadership is key. [A leader “needs to inspire others to deliver sustained superior performance.”\\n“It starts with the heart,” he says. “As a leader, you have to define a preferred future — a goal — that is aspirational and inspirational. …People want to be part of something bigger than themselves.”\\nA leader, he says,”needs to translate the mission to the heads and hearts of the employee.”\\nAt Cadbury, they accommodated resistance, hoping that over time things would change. But that didn’t work, Solomon said. “You have to be unequivocal with the message.”\\n“People don’t always interpret the ‘high road’ in the same way. When leaders go in different direction, you lose focus. You need all heads in the game. …You are either on the bus or off the bus…[You need to] identify strategic priorities in the realization of the end goal. A good leader then translates those strategies into the employee’s day-to-day job.”\\nAt Dr Pepper, he said, “We created a large visual of five core strategies and then used them in our call-to-action workshops — small groups of 20 to 25 employees. We showed them how they could contribute.” All 19,000 staffers participated, creating a real alignment that helped break down old mindsets.\\nIn the foreword to. Translate Motivate Activate,. Young says that Solomon’s human resource skills helped translate Young’s vision for the organization. “Larry effectively engaged our… employees and helped us manage wave upon wave of fundamental change. The innovative methods he developed and implemented helped align the team behind the right priorities, as well as efficiently and effectively build skill sets critical to our success.”\\n“In 2008, we were told that Coca-Cola and Pepsi would crush us,” Young says. “[But] we were small, fast and nimble. With great brands and great people, we deliver great results.”\\nSolomon is donating 100 percent of the sales of his book, Translate Motivate Activate: A Leader’s Guide to Mobilizing Change, toMy Possibilities, a continuing education program for adults with special needs that was co-founded by his wife, Charmaine, a UT Dallas BS ’01 in Interdisciplinary Studies alumna,and two other mothers, all of whom had children with special needs.\\nSolomon is donating 100 percent of the sales of his book\\nAlumniExecutive MBA\\nView all posts by Harriet L.

Howorth, Program Lead\\nI am currently the Program Lead for the Global Development Initiative – part of the Center for Global Business within the Naveen Jindal School of Business, University of Texas at Dallas.My Company, HOWORTH International, specializes in advising and supporting companies in their international market entry initiatives, and through our work with these companies we recruit and onboard companies each semester to be included in the GDI program. In addition to recruiting these companies, I provide mentorship to both the students and the companies as they develop US market research for those companies. Periodically, we develop opportunities for both students and the client companies in the form of follow-on research, internship, and employment opportunities.The Global Development Initiative consistently delivers key market research and valuable market entry advice for client companies as they consider entering the large and attractive USA market.\\nHow does the GDI Program Work?\\nInternational-based companies applying for the GDI Program submit anIndication of Interestand are evaluated for acceptance to the GDI Program based onspecific requirements\\nEach company that is selected is then assigned a team of 3-5 students with one student assigned as theTeam Leader. In addition, an experienced C-level business executive is assigned to the team as aBusiness Mentorand a senior student who is experienced with the program will be assigned to the team as aCoordinator.\\nTeam Leader\\nBusiness Mentor',\n",
              "   'Coordinator\\nAt the beginning of each semester, the students, mentor, and coordinator are introduced to the selected company and its executives and assigned liaison staff. This becomes theGDI Team.\\nGDI Team\\nThe market research project scope is defined and agreed through a Scope of Work and the GDI Team begins their work together with attending in-class lectures in the IMS 4350 Global Market Entry Strategies class.\\nThe GOAL for the GDI Team is to deliver high value to support the company’s market entry plan into the United States market. The scope will include researching market information related to the company’s goods or services, competitive landscape, project/service localization and introduction to individuals and organizations helpful in supporting the company’s market entry strategy.\\nWeekly meetings and progress reports are arranged between the Companies and their GDI Teams.\\nInternational-based Companies – Selection Criteria\\nA minimum US$5 million of annual revenue (unless the Company is a non-revenue operation such as R&D). Lower revenue levels will be considered, depending on the Company’s growth, US market potential, and available capital to support a US market entry strategy.\\nIf the Company is launching a new product or service, it needs to have a proven business model in its home country with a defined revenue model and adequate investment capital.\\nWhile the Companies are not required to pay any fees for the program, preference will be given to companies that have adequate capital and a commitment to invest initially in distribution leading to a presence such as sales office, partnership, manufacturing, or assembly facility in the DFW region.\\nThe Companies need to be able to commit time on a weekly basis to work with the students throughout the semester (approximately 13 to 15 weeks).\\nThe Company needs to have English-speaking representatives that can work effectively with the students.\\nThe Company should not have an existing US office / facility and will work directly with the GDI Program and not through any intermediaries.\\nThe Company has a plan to expand into the US market within two fiscal years and will have a stated preference to locate in the Dallas- Ft. Worth region.\\nGDI Testimonials\\nGDI Student – Israeli Company\\nGDI Student – Israeli Company, Class of Spring 2023 (All Terrain Vehicles)\\nI had the pleasure of being a project leader alongside my team members, coach, and mentor. We gained meaningful international business experience in a domestic learning environment. Various skills such as time management, business meeting conduction, and industrial research were utilized. It is one thing to take classes and learn about global business, it is another thing to be engaged in consultation with an international company.\\nGDI Client Company – Japan\\nGDI Client Company – Japan, Chief Executive, Spring 2023 (74-year-old Spring Manufacturer)\\nThe GDI Program was one of the essential steps for us in expanding our market to the United States, especially while we could not travel to the USA due to COVID-19. We understand that research is critical, and through this program, being in a team with Students with fresh ideas and guided by professionals with experience, the GDI Program helped us understand cultural and market differences.\\nGDI Student – Swedish Company\\nGDI Student – Swedish Company, Class of Spring 2022 (Rural Broadband Development)\\nThank you, Mr. Howorth! And I also want to say thank you for all the help and opportunity you provided me during the Global Development Initiative in 2022. That experience has been priceless during my job interviews as it gave me first-hand involvement working on data procurement and consultation. It was always a talking point and helped me get my current job at Murphy Oil Corporation, so I truly appreciate what you and Professor Zydorek did for us during that course! Thank You!\\nGDI Client Company – Sweden\\nGDI Client Company – Sweden, Company Co-Founder, Spring 2022 (Rural Broadband)\\nWe took part in the GDI program in 2022. The students who worked with us were very helpful in providing market data that assisted us in our further work for entering the USA market. We would recommend any company, globally, that considers approaching the USA market to take advantage of the facilities and services a GDI Student Project Team can provide.\\nI am extremely pleased that I was able to participate in the Global Development Initiative (GDI) internship program. For me, the experience was wonderful and enlightening in many ways. Having to meet mentors and interns who have their distinct individuality, but share a similar cooperative motivation was a first for me. There was never a lack of moments in our collaborations, whether we were serious about accomplishing our goals or laughing about random topics that I would have never expected to appear.\\nGDI Student – Tan Moorthy\\nThe GDI program provides students an opportunity to learn about real business through their understanding of the client companies.

It’s a great slate of presenters.”\\nThe Max Hopper Distinguished Speaker\\nPhillip Dunkelberger, president and CEO of Nok Nok Labs, will be the Max Hopper Distinguished Speaker, the conference’s signature solo event, with his presentation, “Leadership Lessons of Max Hopper in a World of Digital Disruption.” Hopper was one of the original digital disruptors in the travel agency industry, having pioneered the use of the Sabre airline computer reservation system in the mid-1970s.

Podcast\\nbyJeanne Spreier- January 22nd, 2016 -Joining JSOM,JSOM Facts & Figures\\nOne industry is adding 400,000 jobs within the next four years and offersstarting paycommensurate with high-profile careers like engineering and IT.\\n“This isn’t just me saying this,” says Debra Richardson, the Naveen Jindal School of Management program director who started the school’s Risk Management and Insurance program in 2015. Research from theJacobson Group, Deloitte, McKinsey & Company and other firms back her up. She says in her past academic experience, 100 percent of her RMI students got job offers before or upon graduation.\\nRichardson is holding an information meeting about RMI and for the newGamma Iota Sigmastudent organization at 6 p.m., Monday, Feb. 1 inJSOM 2.116. It is through this international professional fraternity, she says, that students make connections to land RMI internships and careers. JSOM students who enter the field will have a strong professional support network through Gamma Iota Sigma, which meets monthly at “fun places,” Richardson promises.\\nAnother benefit of Gamma Iota Sigma membership is scholarships open to RMI and actuary science students.\\nMost students don’t look to the risk management and insurance industry for careers, however, because they don’t like the sound of it. “It sounds boring; it sounds like you’re going to be knocking on doors,” Richardson says. “I was in the business for more than 30 years, and I was never bored — and I had a meaningful and rewarding career, which I want to share with students.”\\nShe asks that students give her one semester — take theFIN 3370 Principles of Risk Management and Insurance. She is pretty sure students will change their minds by the end of the semester. And, even if they don’t go into the profession, she is positive they will have a better understanding of risk than anyone else in their future business environment. Of entrepreneurs, she says, “How can you start your business if you don’t know what can put you out of business?”\\nThe demand for qualified RMI professionals is huge right now, she says, for several reasons: RMI is losing thousands of baby boomer professionals each year as they retire; every business needs risk assessment and insurance so as business creation increases, RMI demand does as well; the global economy requires sophisticated skills to monitor risk; and finally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a level of accountability that draws in RMI experts.\\nDallas-Fort Worth is the southwest epicenter of the RMI industry and ranks No. 3 nationwide for RMI professionals. The JSOM RMI coursework is part of the Finance program, but Richardson says any JSOM student who has the prerequisites may take RMI classes.\\n“Every day there is a story in the news about risk management,” she says, listing stories large and small — from weather debacles, O-ring failures in the NASA space shuttle program, corporate failures because of falling energy demand and product pricing tied to international currency fluctuations. “Every business management major needs to have at least one risk management class,” she says.\\nFor information, contact Richardson at Debra.Richardson@utdallas.edu or visit her office, JSOM 14.401.\\nView all posts by Jeanne Spreier\\nMore from Joining JSOM - Blog Category\\nEverything You Need to Know About Getting an Internship for JSOM\\nStudents in the Naveen Jindal School of Management who follow the Career Management Center’s process are well prepared to find success in their internship and post-graduation job searches.\\nWhere Do Healthcare Management Students Work?\\nMohammad Elashi is a successful entrepreneur who started building his dreams in the healthcare management industry while completing his undergraduate degree at the Jindal School.\\nWhy Do I Have to Study Statistics?\\nIs statistics an important subject?

              "  'chunks': ['Careers\\nResearch Papers\\nHousing Stability and New Business Creation\\nWe investigate whether and how stronger legal protections for renters affect business creation by enhancing housing stability. In California, city ordinances protecting renters from arbitrary evictions led to a 9.9% increase in new businesses, with significant growth among female (8.0%) and racial-minority (12.1%) entrepreneurs. These businesses survive in the long term and perform comparably to others. Household-level analysis reveals that after the laws’ passage, renters are less likely to move, more likely to pursue self-employment and generate higher business income. Our findings indicate that enhancing housing stability contributes positively to the local economy by fostering self-employment and job creation.\\nNeglected Risks in the Communication of Mortgage-Backed Security Offerings\\nExamining the contractual disclosures during the sale of private-label residential mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis, we find that textual contents in the risk-factor section predict subsequent losses and were not reflected in pricing. Insurance companies, especially life insurers, and insurers with low regulatory capital ratios, are more exposed to textual risks. Consistent with issuers hedging litigation risks with disclosure, we find that textual contents are associated with second-lien underreporting and preissuance of written communications. Overall, we find that investors neglected risks in the purportedly safe assets before the crisis.\\nReal Estate Investors and Property Taxation\\nThis paper studies the inequality in property taxation in the U.S. single-family home market\\nTracing the Source of Liquidity for Distressed Housing Markets\\nWe show that profit-seeking institutional investors provide valuable liquidity and spur the recovery of distressed housing markets. Using a quasi-natural experiment wherein investors purchased prepackaged distressed home portfolios from government-sponsored enterprises, we find that transaction prices of properties located within 0.25 miles of bulk-sale properties increased by 1.4% more than homes located farther away. This positive price spillover effect helped reverse the discounts at which such properties were being sold prior to the bulk-sale event. The price spillover effect due to the bulk-sale event is greater for foreclosed homes (4.1%), homes similar to bulk-sale homes (2.5%) and homes in highly distressed neighborhoods (7.0%). Our results highlight asset disposition through pooling and institutional participation as a potential market-driven channel for the recovery of distressed housing markets.\\nDo Wall Street Landlords Undermine Renters’ Welfare?\\nWe examine the recent rise of institutional investment in the single-family home rental market and its implications for renters’ welfare. Using institutional mergers to identify local exogenous variation in institutional landlords’ scale and market share, we show that rents increase in neighborhoods where both merging firms owned properties (i.e., overlapped neighborhoods) relative to other nonoverlapped neighborhoods. Meanwhile, the crime rate also significantly decreases in overlapped neighborhoods after mergers. Our findings suggest that while institutional landlords leverage their market power to extract greater surplus from renters, they also improve the quality of rental services by enhancing neighborhood safety.\\nRacial Disparities in Mortgage Lending: New Evidence Based on Processing Time\\nThis paper examines racial disparities in mortgage processing time prior to the global financial crisis. We find that Black borrowers are underrepresented and experience a longer processing time than white borrowers among the mortgages securitized by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). At the same time, Black borrowers are overrepresented and face a similar processing time among privately securitized (PLS) mortgages. Additionally, Black borrowers are strongly associated with faster segments of the mortgage markets, faster lenders within each segment and the types of loan products that are processed faster, all of which subsequently experienced higher defaults.\\nSubprime Mortgage Defaults and Credit Default Swaps\\nWe offer the first empirical evidence on the adverse effect of credit default swap (CDS) coverage on subprime mortgage defaults. Using a large database of privately securitized mortgages, we find that higher defaults concentrate in mortgage pools with concurrent CDS coverage, and within these pools the loans originated after or shortly before the start of CDS coverage have an even higher delinquency rate. The results are robust across zip code and origination quarter cohorts. Overall, we show that CDS coverage helped drive higher mortgage defaults during the financial crisis.\\nAuthors\\nHarold Huibing Zhang\\nArea Coordinator, Finance and Managerial Economicsharold.zhang@utdallas.edu|(972)-883-4777\\nharold.zhang@utdallas.edu|(972)-883-4777\\nUmit Gurun, PhD\\nStan Liebowitz Professor, Accounting\\numit.gurun@utdallas.edu|972-883-5917\\nFeng Zhao\\nProfessor\\nfeng.zhao@utdallas.edu|(972)-883-5815\\nSteven Xiao\\nAssociate Professor, Finance and Managerial Economics PhD Area Coordinator, Finance, PhD Programs\\nsteven.xiao@utdallas.edu|972-883-5056\\nSerena Wenjing Xiao']},\n",

As a student who joined during quarantine, it was the first time I connected with hard-working Finance students in JSOM! I strongly recommend you step into the lab and have conversations with lab workers and students. You can study as a group and access financial tools and databases in the lab. The finance lab provides various workshops, competitions, and events, which enhanced my analytical and technical skills and prepared me for the job market. As an MS Finance alumnus who currently works for a financial service company, I can proudly say that Finance Lab helped me get this job. The tableau competition and Capital IQ workshops specifically guided me on using databases and enhancing my visualization skills. The Finance Lab always welcomes everyone and feeds their curious minds. One should enter and explore the intriguing place JSOM Finance lab is!\\nHui (Vivienne) Zhi, MSF SPRING 2020\\nI worked in the Finance Lab from Fall 2019 to Spring 2020 as a student worker. Any day I was on campus, the Lab was a must-go stop. Like we always say: “I’ll meet you at the Lab.” The Finance lab offered some great resources to current students, whether we’re working on course-related papers, case competitions, or just want to self-learn and get familiar with some financial modeling databases.  Every semester, the lab arranges a variety of events to enhance the students’ experience and provides an excellent platform for students to network and talk to professionals, professors, and alumni.\\nAyushi Gupta, MSF FALL 2019\\nDuring my time at the lab, I learned tools like the Morning Star, Thomson Reuters Eikon, Bloomberg, and Tableau which were very instrumental in adding an extra edge to the project work and in detailed research of financial information to solve cast studies. I continue to use the interpersonal skill and financial knowledge I imbibed at the lab in my current role as an Investment Analyst. Being a part of the lab has been a great learning experience and I hope more students get a chance to explore the lab’s resources.\\nShreya Hazare, MSF SPRING 2020\\nThe experience at the Finance trading lab has been one of the most enriching periods during my MS finance course. My one and a half years at Finance lab as a Student worker, TA, and Lab manager has been a great learning experience. With Lab workers, it always felt like an extended family.

This is Ben (Zhiyao) Zhao, I am currently working as a full time Credit Risk Senior Analyst at Citigroup. During my time at UTD, I worked as a graduate teaching assistant for Finance Trading Lab during calendar year 2020. This was one of my beautiful times at college. I not only learned necessary skills I am using day to day now, but also participated in many interesting events and made friends. Finance lab provides opportunities for students to learn and touch financial tools that many financial institutions are using. I learned how to use FactSet and Capital IQ, learned how to obtain financial resources such as projection, debt structure, and credit ratings. I also got the chance to have many leaderships experiences as organize Finance lab’s events and schedule. I was networking at Finance Lab getting to know many professionals, studying at Finance Lab to learn knowledge, and helping students to understand financial materials. This was a memorable experience I will always take in mind.\\nSalman Jasim, MSF SPRING 2020\\nThe Finance Lab has been an integral part of my education and career thus far. The skills I had acquired are imperative to my work. It was here that I had learnt about S&P Cap IQ, and Bloomberg, two tools that I use on a daily basis. Aside, from the technical skills, I also got to learn about the various aspects of the Finance realm from the many different speakers that have graced the lab over time and the extraordinary peers I got to work with.\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Podcast\\nbyJustin Ehlert- February 17th, 2016 -JSOM Facts & Figures,Student Spotlight\\nThe last thing anyone would expect you as a college student to do isstart your own business. We students have enough on our plates as it is: difficult classes, homework every night, multiple exams on the same day, jobs, sports, extracurricular activities and more. Our free time needs to be used doing something we enjoy just so that we can maintain our sanity. However, for some of us, the challenge of starting a business and the subsequent stress is worth it.\\nAt the end of my freshman year, I started a mobile app development company calledJump Space Apps. My goal in founding this company was to create mobile applications for small to medium-size companies with several of my colleagues. We have been around for three years now and have worked with more than a dozen companies. At times this experience has been difficult, but at others it’s been incredibly fun.\\nI’ve always been the type of person who learns from failure and experience. I’d be lying if I said that Jump Space Apps has always been perfect; however, the challenges I’ve faced with Jump Space have given me critical insight to problem solving in the business world. Hopefully, I can pass this insight on to my fellow students, especially in myENTP 3320 Startup Launch I course, and see them start their own business when they may not have started otherwise. My experiences can be summed up in three main pieces of advice: Understand your strengths and weaknesses; ask for help; and think of yourself in the same way you want your customers to think of you.\\nNo one person has every skill necessary to run a successful business. Some of us are very good at the technical side but lack marketing skills. Some of us are very good salesmen but don’t actually know how to create a tangible product. This is OK. When starting your own business, it is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of every member of your team. If you know that you are lacking in the marketing area, try to find someone that is good at it. By finding someone else to either join your team or mentor you in a particular area, you can allow yourself to keep doing what you do best. Your business will benefit much more from having multiple people in specialized roles rather than trying to take everyone and have them do something that they are not good at. Additionally, by putting yourself around other people who have the skills you are missing, you will acquire those skills too.\\nLearning skills from other people is one of the most important parts of starting your own business. The best way to do this is to simply ask for help from those around you. UT Dallas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area have a wealth of entrepreneurial knowledge. What you’ll also find is that we are all willing to help. The Dallas Entrepreneur Center has designated times where anyone can go in and get helpful advice from successful entrepreneurs. UT Dallas and theNaveen Jindal School of Managementhave a plethora of faculty that would love to help you start your business. When you have questions, go ask them. Spending 30 minutes with someone who has been in your shoes will be significantly more beneficial than you trying to figure it out on your own.\\nWhen you’ve understood your strengths and weaknesses and have asked for help from those around you, then it’s time to start thinking about your image and how your customers perceive you. At first, we advertised Jump Space Apps as a company comprised of college students that could do work for a little bit less than those other guys. This worked for a while, but it resulted in us getting clients that really weren’t anything to write home about. We noticed that a lot of our clients didn’t take us seriously purely because we were college students. Even though we produced high-quality work, they couldn’t shake the fact that we were just college students.\\nSo we decided to start thinking of ourselves the way we would have wanted our clients to think of us. We took ourselves more seriously. We marketed ourselves as more experienced, provided work samples to prove it and eventually adjusted our prices to better reflect the quality of our work. This resulted in us getting more clients, and those clients were higher profile and much more fun to work with. It turned out that our clients wanted to work with a confident company that they could trust; all it took was us believing that we could deliver that.\\nIf you are thinking about starting your own business, feel free to reach out to me atjxe120230@utdallas.edu.

Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- June 9th, 2017 -Academics,Alumni,Corporate,Development,Students\\nA recent real estate case competition netted a team of students from the Naveen Jindal School of Management a second-place finish, $3,000 and an object lesson in business networking.\\nDanielle Walts, who is pursuing dual degrees inFull-Time MBAandMS in Finance, heard about the competition during an Introduction to Real Estate (REAL 6321) course taught byDr. Randall S. Guttery. She assembled a team of fellow MBA cohort members Marco Pisterzi and Daniel O’Dell, Brian Korver, who is in the Professional MBA Flex program; and Miguel Limongi, Executive MBA 2016, who is now pursuing a master’s degree in finance with a concentration in real estate.\\nThe competition, the 12th annual Texas Shoot Out Real Estate MBA Case Challenge, was organized by theNorth Texas chapterof the National Association for Industrial and Office Parks, a commercial real estate development association. Teams from Baylor, SMU, Texas A&M, Texas Tech, UT Arlington, UT Austin and UT Dallas were tasked with developing and submitting a best and final offer price for two undeveloped parcels in Plano totaling 13.64 acres. The land is a part ofLegacy Central, an 84-acre office and mixed-use development located on the site of the former Texas Instruments campus at Legacy Drive and Central Expressway.\\n“I just wanted to have a good showing and gain some experience,” said Limongi, who has 15 years’ experience in the accounting side of real estate. “I’ve been in real estate for a while, but I’ve never done a full case. I’ve done pieces, but I’ve never seen how a full deal is put together. I wanted to learn all that.”\\nThe team members had a little more than two weeks to put together their case. Before they received their instructions, they reached out to Jindal School alumnus Edmund Lord, MBA 2016 — who had participated in the two previous competitions — for some high-level advice.\\n“I walked the team through a highest- and best-use analysis and told them to focus on clarity rather than complexity on the financial analysis part,” said Lord, a senior investment associate at Diamond Realty Investments, Inc. “I also told them that in past years we got dinged because we focused too much on putting together a good PowerPoint but didn’t walk through it enough times to make it sound fluid when it was our turn to present.”\\nArmed with Lord’s advice, the team members received their instructions, put together their case and polished their presentation. On April 6, they presented their findings in front of a panel of seven judges —all of whom hold leadership positions in the commercial real estate industry, including some NAIOP board members and a representative from Legacy Central.\\n“I told my teammates that we may go into it and we may not win, but it’s important to meet people,” Walts said. “That’s a big part of how you get your name out there and people remember you. To win second place is just icing on the cake.”\\nThe networking was important for Limongi, too. Even so, he was pleased with his team’s second-place showing (UT Austin took the first-place $6,000 prize).\\n“One of the judges said that, if this was a real deal, he would have put his own money into our team’s presentation,” Limongi said.\\nWalts took her own networking advice. She met Julie Lynch, principal atLYNOUS Talent Management, who wrote the case for this competition and was recruiting at the event.\\n“She offered me a temporary position for this summer,” Walts said. “When she found out I used to be a commercial real estate property manager before I came to the full-time program, she offered to turn it into an internship, so I ended up taking it. It’s a great company and a great opportunity. If it all works out, they’re looking to add someone to their staff in about year. That’s right about the same time I will be graduating.”\\nFor Guttery, who has dedicated his career to advancing other people’s careers, the students’ experience in this competition serves as a pleasant reminder that the real-estate programs he directs are right on track in fulfilling their intended purposes of education and making connections.\\n“These events are such great experiences for the students,” he said. “We on the faculty are so proud of them for going above and beyond what is required of them in the classroom. They’re not only confronting real-world challenges but taking advantage of the tremendous opportunities they have to network with potential employers. The financial reward this time was pretty sweet, too.”\\nView all posts by Jimmie Markham\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Students will learn the tools and skills they need to pursue PhD programs related to accounting. Five three-hour courses include a doctoral writing and teaching seminar, advanced managerial economics, econometrics and special topics courses related to accounting that students would take twice.\\n“If you look at the sciences, the typical progression of knowledge is undergraduate work, then you do your master’s in a specific field, and then you move over to your PhD and dive deep into that focused field,” saidDr. Suresh Radhakrishnan, Constantine Konstans Distinguished Professor of Corporate Governance and Accounting, who is director of the program. “Accounting is more like medicine in that you have clinical and research sides.”\\nRules in public accounting change so rapidly, Radhakrishnan said, that students necessarily have to focus their education much more on applied accounting than on its theoretical aspects in order to become prepared to pursue career opportunities in that field.\\n“This certificate program is basically a bridge,” he said. “We are trying to help accounting graduate students understand what it means to employ scientific rigor in academic research so that they can make a more informed choice as to whether they want to pursue a PhD. If they decide to do so, this program will give them a good foundation from which to build upon.”\\nHoyoun Kyung andPinar Gencerboth worked in industry after earning their master’s degrees. They are now pursuing PhDs in management science with concentrations in accounting at the Jindal School. For both students, deciding between a professional and academic career boils down to whether you prefer to deal with the known or the unknown.\\n“When you work as a practitioner, you answer questions that other people ask,” said Kyung, who worked at Samsung Electronics as a corporate accountant. “As a researcher, you have the freedom to explore your own questions and dig into what you find interesting and feel passionate about.”\\nWhat most appeals to Gencer about doing research is solving puzzles, which the former investment banker has enjoyed doing since childhood. When the opportunity arose to pursue a PhD, she became excited about the opportunity to solve problems related to accounting, finance and economics. She also liked the idea of teaching and being able to share her ideas with others.“This program is a really good idea,” she said. “It is a very good introduction to an academic career — especially the seminars and the doctoral writing and teaching.

Its services are used by financial institutions, developers, corporations and government agencies to assess the value, use and feasibility of real estate.\\nJody Hassemer, CPA, the chief financial officer of the Dallas office and head of human resources, said the UT Dallas students arrive “with a great skill set for what we need. And they go above and beyond what’s expected.”\\nInterns at the company work with a group of four appraisers, doing research and collecting data. They track the details that make up an appraisal. For interns, learning opportunities abound. “They learn how to be a little intuitive about collecting data,” Hassemer said. “They work on all sorts of different projects and get exposed to different property types.”\\nBabak Davani, an analyst intern last semester, said the “position plays a very important role at Integra.” President of the Financial Leadership Association at UT Dallas, a student organization, Davani said appraisers could not complete their valuations without his research and analysis. “I’ve taken a valuation course at UT Dallas as part of my MS in Finance degree, so I understand what the appraisers are doing, and I understand the importance of my contribution.”\\nJoseph Pytcher, an MBA student with a bachelor’s degree in finance, works full time as a real estate analyst at IRR. He had worked in the mortgage industry during his undergraduate years but wanted to work as an analyst to utilize his finance degree.\\n“I wanted to stay in real estate since I have been on the residential side for quite some time,” Pytcher said. However, being with IRR, it pushed me over to the commercial side. Learning about what actually goes into the valuation and how the value is determined are what interest me.”']},\n",

Engineering students take these assignments to complete a required two-semester capstone project. For a price (in the $10,000 range), off-campus inventors expand their resources by using UTDesign students to help hunt for solutions. Companies get fresh young minds tackling their problem with all results turned over to them at the end of the project.\\nPart of the pitch to companies, says Rod Wetterskog, Jonsson School assistant dean for corporate relations, “is that we say, ‘JSOM is a partner with this program. If you want Jonsson School students to develop the technology, and Jindal School students to develop the business application, you will have a complete package,’ ”. If companies express interest in JSOM, he connects them with Haworth.\\nWorking on projects like these, Haworth says, is a huge competitive advantage for JSOM students’ job searches.\\nThe idea for the app that Hillier and Garcia researched was dreamed up by two local healthcare professionals who wanted an easy way to find times when they could meet for social events. What if an app would synch the calendars of two people to identify those mutually free times?\\nHillier and Garcia researched comparable apps on the market and learned from a doctoral student at JSOM how apps diffuse through the marketplace. Hillier ran focus groups, with help from Garcia.\\nHillier and Garcia, who earned a grade for their work, met at least weekly last semester to reach their self-imposed (and Haworth-approved) deadlines and deliverables. They completed monetization plans, a competitive analysis, market research and diffusion/branding issues.\\nHaworth is excited about the growing collaborative relationship with UTDesign. “It’s experiential learning, it puts our students at a competitive advantage,” she says. For companies, she says, it’s a no-brainer. “The (investors) get real IP (intellectual property) out of this for a very low cost.”\\nMore from Rotator\\nAmerican Heart Association to Honor Associate Dean for Community Impact\\nAccounting Students Score Scholarships from the Texas Society of CPAs\\nBig Idea Competition Finals Will Put Kawasaki’s Art of Innovation on Display\\nThe iPhone X:  Will it pop or will it fizzle?\\nJindal School Alumna Earns Women in Technology Award\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

One was for the Texas Christian University (TCU) Graduate Supply Chain Case Competition on April 1; the other was the 2023 Business Analytics Student Competition held at the University of Texas at Arlington.\\nFirst, the TCU competition.\\nJindal School Team Takes First After Finding Company Bottleneck\\nWith a first-place prize of $14,000 on the line and sponsored by well-known companies, including H-E-B, the judges from TrinityRail put an actual company problem before participants, with one of the judges having written the case competition.',\n",
              "   'Bhanu Pulikonda, an MBA in supply chain management student, appreciated the application to her chosen area. “It allowed me to get an inside view and really see how supply chain can struggle,” Pulikonda said. “It was motivating that it was a 100-percent real-world case.”\\nJohn Fierst, director of theMS in Management ScienceandMS in Supply Chain Managementprograms in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, saw this as a key supply chain education victory for the Jindal School in the wake ofa top-4 rankingin the Gartner Supply Chain University Top 25 for 2022.\\n“You look at our Gartner ranking, and this competition is one more example that we’re heading in a strong direction,” he said. “It shows students can apply knowledge because these competitions are all about an application from the classroom. It says our students don’t just understand theory but can put it into practice.”\\nAnother Competition, Another First-Place Finish\\nThe 2023 Business Analytics Student Competition also saw the Jindal School hit the mark in this annual event sponsored this year by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). It took place as part of the 7th Annual Business Analytics Symposium held at UT Arlington.\\nThe first round of the event consisted of 52 teams sending in a problem statement, a document describing how they would approach the problem.\\n“It focused on the impressions for a campaign, and we were provided a data set to analyze,” said Shaurya Tripathi, an MS in business analytics student. “It was a marketing television problem. It was looking at when campaigns are run, the dates of the running and the impression metrics, social metrics and how people are engaging. Our goal was to maximize the clicks from being provided the marketing budget of $1 million.”\\nThe top three teams were invited to give a 15-minute presentation on the topic and, the judges, all from HPE, gave their results.\\n“It was a strong challenge and fun to get involved with this marketing problem,” said Shritej Chavan, an MS in business analytics student. “It wasn’t straightforward when you talk about ROI and we had to come up with metrics. We really had to focus in terms of analyzing data.”\\nThe team, which won $1,000 and a certificate, appreciated being judged by HPE, providing a balance in terms of the backgrounds of the judges.\\n“You really felt that they appreciated the time we gave in terms of coming up with an algorithm that could fit,” Chavan said.\\nTripathi said it improved his skills in teamwork and when it comes to combining strategy with technical skills.\\n“You can understand a topic but as a graduate student you don’t always get a chance to put your knowledge to the test this way,” he said. “Marketing campaigns, budget allocation, it’s exciting to put it into play. It was a great opportunity to present in front of top experts, such as Paul Hemmersbaugh. Leveraging algorithms is a skill which can have wide-ranging application.”\\nDr. Bill Hefley, a clinical professor and program director of theMS Business Analytics Cohortprogram at the Jindal School, was proud of the team and how they were able to display their knowledge from the classroom.\\n“It’s a powerful feeling to be able to act almost like an adviser and to see successful people from a business like this taking in your expertise and getting a chance to understand your mindset,” he said. “We have seen again and again that our students understand business in action, and it translates when they go out into the marketplace. You hear it about our graduates a great deal…To finish first out of that many teams is a terrific achievement.”\\xa0 Teams from the Jindal School placed first and second this year; Jindal teams had placed first and third in the competition’s inaugural year, which was sponsored by Pier 1.\\nView all posts by Eric Butterman\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Podcast\\nbyGlenda Vosburgh- January 9th, 2024 -Academics,Events,Students\\nA recent event held by UTDsolv at theNaveen Jindal School of Managementshowcased projects in which teams of seniors collaborated throughout semester with industry professionals.\\xa0 Students utilized the knowledge and skills acquired in their undergraduate academic careers to solve real-world business problems.\\nThe inaugural UTDsolv Capstone Expo Event at the Jindal School celebrated the accomplishments of the fall 2023UTDsolv Capstonestudents. The top 12 projects were presented, and awards were given to the top three during the Dec. 13 event.\\nUTDsolv is a business platform that develops innovative solutions to real-life business problems, particularly when companies have no available time and resources to devote to finding answers.\\xa0The program connects companies with talented undergraduate business students who also are future entrepreneurs and leaders. Students work on projects throughout the semester in small groups as part of their capstone senior project and under the guidance of our faculty and company advisors. The program is a requirement for all JSOM senior students.\\nAt the Jindal School, we are very focused on preparing our students to contribute from day one,” saidDr. Hasan Pirkul, Caruth Chair and Jindal School dean. “Our professors educate, and project-based education is important to get them ready. (UTDsolv) is the course where we put the finishing touches on our students before they go out into their professional careers.”\\nFirst place and $2,000 was awarded to the Prosper Police Department project team, which created a system for the police department to analyze their crime data and an interactive visualization to help communicate the information in their monthly reports.\\nSecond-place honors and $1,500 went to the McLaren Automotive project team who focused on determining ways to turbo-charge the company’s customer retention rate.\\nThird place and $1,000 was awarded to the project team who worked for a digital technology services company, PriceSenz. The focus was to create a seamless user experience for recruiters and candidates using ChatGPT-like capabilities and facilitate effortless matchmaking between talent resumes and available jobs.\\nJudges were Kenya Allen, senior manager of HR at Lennox International; Lucie Anderson, senior director of Pricing Operations at Quest Diagnostics; Adam Camarena, director of operations at Steris Corp. and Ray Hemmig, chairman of Restaurant & Retail Growth Capital and chairman of the advisory council for JSOM’s RISE Center. Hemmig is also a member of the Jindal School’s Advisory Council.\\nSince\\xa0the beginning of UTDsolv, students have worked with 263 companies on projects valued at more than $7 million.\\n“(Project-based programs) are common in engineering, but not in business,” saidDr. Dawn Owens, associate dean ofundergraduate programsat the Jindal School and a clinical professor in theInformation Systems Area. “We appreciate all our sponsors, which include repeat sponsors. That says a lot about the program. Our students can put this on their résumés, and some have told me that once a company they’ve applied to sees that, it is all they want to talk about. We want employers to seek us out to be a part of the program.”\\nJudges at the expo, who represented companies that have worked with students in UTDsolv, agreed that for the companies and the students, the program is mutually beneficial.\\n“It is a resource for the companies and the students learn about real-world companies,” Anderson said.\\xa0“The program also allows us to build relationships. Even if those students go somewhere else, we always have the relationship formed by working together on these projects.”\\n“Lennox is a neighbor of the Jindal School, and it makes sense for us to partner with them,” Allen said. “We are the longest-term company in the program, and it has been a positive experience. We have found a lot of talent here and many of the leaders in our company were educated here.”\\nAccording toDr. David R. Parks, assistant dean of capstone projects at the Jindal School and a professor of practice in itsOperations Management Area, the program was an elective before transitioning to a required class.']},\n",

              "  'chunks': [\"She credits the Jindal School with teaching her the many lessons that she continues to use today. “One lesson that I have applied to my career is focusing on accomplishing my goal,” she said. “I have achieved many milestones in my career by having a clear, concise plan.\\nInspired by her former mentor, Debi Carter, BS 1993, who created an endowment at the Jindal School, Sheikh decided to do the same and established theSaadia Sheikh Scholarship/Fellowship for Entrepreneurship. This is the first endowed scholarship/fellowship for undergraduate or graduate students studying entrepreneurship.\\n“I wanted to give back to the university that gave so much to me and inspire other students to be entrepreneurial, which is a major factor in real estate,” she said.\\nFor Sheikh, success and philanthropy go hand in hand. “I truly believe philanthropy comes from the good intentions and goodwill to serve others,” she said. “It is important to have the balance of philanthropy in your life with the natural human instinct to win and be successful. We are all only as successful as the community and environment around us.”\\nFostering Compassion in Others\\n“My most indelible lessons from the Jindal School during my time there were to form teams early in the process, respect each other’s strengths, address the weaknesses together and include the present as well as the future in every decision,” said Gigi Edwards Bryant, GLEMBA 2002, founder and president of GMSA Management.\\nAfter re-engaging with UT Dallas through theInstitute for Excellence in Corporate Governanceand seeing the changes and improvements to the Jindal School, Bryant was inspired to give back. TheGigi Edwards Bryant Champions Scholarshipwill be awarded to undergraduate or graduate students who have previously been in foster care and/or have made a positive impact on the lives of children in the foster-care system through volunteerism or advocacy.\\n“I wanted the scholarship to be specific to children in the foster-care system and the people that support them because that support is lacking for our children,” said Bryant. “I am committed to their well-being and supporting their education, but, mostly, I believe that ‘foster’ is not an indicator as to what children are born for — it’s a very expensive indicator as to how we are failing our children. Education can and will change the mindset and the dynamics, if not for the past, then certainly for the future. It did it for me, and I was thrilled to find out that this was the first of its kind for UT Dallas.”\\nEdwards believes that philanthropy and compassion are synonymous. “I taught my children to be kind and caring, and embracing giving as a way of life became a family practice,” she said. “Philanthropy is equally important to women and men because we participate from all different interests, communities and beliefs. The key is concentrating on the efforts of your time, talents and treasures in order to do the most good.”\\nFinancing the Gift of Education\\nThe graduate degree in finance that Judy Hendrick, MS 1986, chief financial officer for Aimbridge Hospitality, earned at UT Dallas directly impacted her career. “My undergraduate degree is in psychology from Kansas State University, but I could not afford to continue going to school full time, so I accepted a position with Chase Manhattan’s loan office in Dallas in office administration and contract administration,” said Hendrick. “I soon realized that it would be helpful if I had more understanding of financial statements, and by taking classes at night for several years, I was able to earn my master’s degree and advance my career further than I ever thought possible.”\\nHendrick decided to help others do the same by establishing theHazel Elise Rogers Scholarship/Fellowship for Finance, the first endowed scholarship/fellowship in finance, in honor of her mother.\\n“My mother has always inspired me to pursue education and a rewarding career,” said Hendrick. “I feel like it is my way of showing her how much that means to me by establishing this scholarship in her name.”\\nGiving back is not an option but a requirement for Hendrick, and it is the greatest privilege for her to be in a position to do so.\\n“Philanthropy is scriptural and is clearly explained in Luke 12:48, which says that from those who much is given, much is required in return,” she said. “I also believe in the gift of giving, which brings back rewards to the giver. What could be more rewarding than to see that you can help someone gain an education who might not be able to otherwise? And then that person can perpetuate that philosophy and help others.”\\nFor information on establishing endowed scholarships, visitjindal.utdallas.edu/give.\\nHerbert D.

              "  'chunks': ['Trailblazing Prof Delivers Polykarp Kusch Lecture on Supply Chain Efficiency\\nAlumni Spotlights\\nTestimonials\\nNewsletters\\nG.O.A.T. Podcast\\nbyJill Glass- August 3rd, 2016 -Events,Faculty/Research\\nThe secret to a supply chain’s success is designing a contract that encourages partners in a supply chain—including suppliers and retailers—to collaborate and make decisions that are in the best interest of the supply chain as a whole, says a renowned operations management professor at the Naveen Jindal School of Management.\\nDr. Suresh Sethi, Eugene McDermott Chair of operations management, spoke recently to students, staff and faculty members at the 2016 Polykarp Kusch Lecture. Sethi’s talk, “Conflicts in Supply Chains and Contracts that Restore Efficiency,” concerned the most efficient way to design supply chains, the relationships that exist between independent groups that cooperate to take raw materials and deliver them to customers as finished products or services.\\nSethi is internationally recognized for applying quantitative methods to areas of manufacturing and operations management, finance, economics and marketing.\\nSuppliers and retailers make independent decisions based on their own self-interests in a decentralized manner, often leading to decisions that are not best for the total supply chain, Sethi told the audience. However, companies that collaborate effectively across the supply chain enjoy dramatic reductions in inventories and costs, along with improvements in speed, service levels and customer satisfaction.\\n“There’s invariably a conflict between the two agents with their own objectives trying to maximize their profits. It’s a tug of war in some sense. One of the two of course has more control. So there is this loss of efficiency, which is not as good as when the two can collaborate and make decisions together that benefit all,” Sethi said. “We can design contracts that align each one’s objective with the objective of the total supply chain.”\\nFor example, Sethi described the competing self-interests that exist between a book supplier and a book retailer. It is in the supplier’s best interest to sell as many books to the retailer as possible; however, it is in the retailer’s best interest to buy only a quantity he is certain he can actually sell.\\n“The retailer is facing an uncertain demand, and when he orders too much, he will get stuck with many books that he cannot sell. That’s why the retailer independently will order a lesser quantity than if the supply chain were one company, because he does not want to take the risk of getting stuck with too many unsold products given the uncertain demand he faces,” Sethi said.\\nThere are contracts that will allow the supplier and retailer to make decisions independently but also ensure maximum profitability for both parties, Sethi said. One such contract is a “buyback contract” that allows the retailer to return unsold books to the supplier at an agreed-upon price, reducing the retailer’s risk and encouraging him to order a higher quantity.\\n“There are a number of wholesale and buyback prices that the supplier can design that will allow the retailer to order just the quantity that is good for the total supply chain,” Sethi said.\\nSethi’s research areas are supply chain management, stochastic inventory models, dynamic advertising problems and mathematical finance. He developed the first stochastic advertising model, known as the Sethi model, which is used to analyze the dynamic relationship between advertising and sales.\\nWhen he arrived at UT Dallas in 1997, he embarked on building a first-class group in operations management and established theoperations management doctoral program, which is now recognized worldwide.\\nSethi was introduced at the lecture by Dr. Hasan Pirkul, Jindal School dean and Caruth Chair of Management.\\n“I have seen many senior faculty members who have hired many outstanding faculty members. They tend to be in their field or close to their research area. Dr. Sethi, on the other hand, has hired great faculty members who are not in his field and have nothing to do with what he does. To me, that’s truly a sign of great intelligence,” Pirkul said. “He has respect for research regardless of the research paradigm the research takes place in, and he respects people who have accomplished in their own disciplines. That has made it possible for us to put together a world-class operations department. We owe you one, Suresh, and we can never repay you and the University can never repay you.”\\nPolykarp Kusch was the 1955 Nobel laureate in physics. He joined UT Dallas in 1972 and was a UT System Regental Professor. When he retired, the University endowed a program of annual lectures with the theme “Concerns of the Lively mind” in his honor.\\nMS Supply Chain Management\\nView all posts by Jill Glass\\nMore from Events - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nGovernment, Industry and Academic Sectors Collide at Jindal School Sustainability Event\\nNew Student-Led Event at UT Dallas Focuses on Pitches for Budding Entrepreneurs\\nUndergraduate Deans Conference at Jindal School Provides Forum for Solving Thorny Issues in Higher-Ed\\nAdvancing Marketing Science: Key Discussions from the Jindal School’s 2025 Bass FORMS Conference\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

This course is followed by a series of required courses that provide a comprehensive examination of specific functional areas: employment law, talent acquisition, compensation and benefits, learning and development, performance management, and organizational change management. Students can supplement these courses with electives in labor relations, HR analytics, leadership, management development, and negotiations. The final required course is the capstone course in which students develop an HR strategy for a local business. That strategy encompasses all the aspects of human resource management, and student’s final strategies are usually presented to the chief Human Resource officer of the participating organization.\\nLike all undergraduate programs in the Jindal School, the BS in HRM program requires students to complete an internship with a local employer in which they apply the knowledge they have gained in school to real-world settings with real-world consequences. The Dallas /Fort Worth Metroplex is home to thousands of organizations, large and small, and is the ideal place to begin a career in HR through an internship.\\nThe Jindal School has a faculty that combines research and academic interests with real-world experience. Most faculty members work or have worked in industry in a variety of senior HR and consulting roles prior to joining UT Dallas. This unique combination of knowledge, experience and contacts enables the faculty to appropriately prepare students for a future in human resource management.\\nMore from BS Human Resource Management FAQ\\nWhat is Human Resource Management?\\nWhat do HR professionals do?\\nWhat kind of job can I get after completing the program?\\nWhen is the best time for me to start thinking about the job search?\\nWhat is the Society for Human Resource Management?\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

The competitive awards, upped this year from $10,000 to $15,000 apiece, go to graduate business students across Texas who have demonstrated leadership and entrepreneurial skills.\\n“I tell the students on Day One that you get out of an MBA program what you put into it. Hazem is living proof of that,” Lisa Shatz, JSOM’s assistant dean for MBA programs, said about Elshorbagy’s scholarship success. “Although he takes his academics seriously, he has put himself out there to try every experience possible and to learn as much as he can from alumni, mentors, faculty, employers.”']},\n",

Each graduate program will be represented and program directors will be available to discuss program specifics.\\n“Fast-track is one of the best ways for our undergraduate students who are thinking of a graduate degree to use their time, money and their credits specifically toward a graduate program,” saidDr. Gaurav Shekhar, an assistant professor of instruction in the Jindal School’sInformation Systems Areaand senior assistant dean forgraduate programsandgraduate student experience. “It’s also a good way for them to test if this is something that they want to do.”\\nFast-tracking provides students with up to $10,000 in potential cost savings as compared with students who take the traditional route to graduate school. The estimated wage gap for someone with a master’s degree in information technology and management versus their counterpart with only a bachelor’s degree is about 15-20%, Shekhar said.']},\n",

              "  'chunks': ['Tapping into App Development Advances\\nThe stepped-up pace of automation owes a lot to advances in app development, Shekhar says, and the RPA course has tapped into that, too, via an industry partnership with Appian, a Virginia-based software developer and cloud-computing company, that gives students access to the Appian Low-code Automation Platform.\\nNot familiar with low code? Think of it his way, Shekhar says: If you were assigned to create a new computer application from scratch, you likely would write 100,000 lines or more of computer commands — code — to make the app work. On a low-code platform, a lot of the commands you need are already created and packaged in a way — in icons, labels or visual images —that you can drag and drop them into your new program. Commands like “Start,” “Submit,” “Return to Home,” for instance, are low-code staples.\\nAt the end of creating a new app on a low-code platform, you may need to write some new code to label your program or differentiate it, Shekhar says. “So, yes, you should know how write code before you sign up for RPA. But with the low-code platform, instead of writing 100,000 lines of code, you write 3,000.”\\nNot only are the ease and speed at which you can create an app greatly improved, Shekhar says, “but think of how many more apps you can create.”\\nAlthough low code has been around about a decade, demand for it and for IT professionals who know how to use it has been accelerating.\\nJSOM Connects\\nA chance encounter between Jindal School faculty and Appian executives led JSOM to first partner with Appian to give students a five-day low-code training workshop over spring break in 2019, Shekhar says.\\nBut he did not recognize “a disconnect” between demand for low-coding and professionals able to use it until he went to an Appian User’s Group meeting the Jindal School hosted that same year. What participants from almost 60 organizations represented at that meeting mainly discussed were the skill sets they needed but were not finding in job applicants, Shekhar says, and he realized that as a “great tech talent provider,” JSOM should equip more students with low-code training.\\nShekhar subsequently made low-code development with Appian the basis for a new-in-2019 Digital Consulting Project (MIS 6349) senior capstone class.\\nBy the next year, the class project delivered AI-based intelligent document processing to business operations at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.\\nResults “were impressive,” Michael Youngs, vice president of Information Technology Services at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, said in an Appian news release in February. Students provided new artificial intelligence capabilities “that will reduce our need for paper forms and accelerate our business processes. This is furthering DFW Airport’s commitment to modernize and digitalize its business processes airport-wide.”\\n“UTD is at the forefront in understanding the tremendous career opportunities available to graduates with low-code expertise.” Michael Beckley, founder and chief technology officer at Appian, commented in that same release.\\nThe Digital Consulting Project course will be back this fall, Shekhar says, as will Robotic Process Automation (BUAN 6385) — which will have an additional professional incentive: Students who complete the course will get free one-time access to the Appian Level I Developer certification exam.\\nAIArtificial IntelligenceCenter for Information Technology and ManagementMS Business Analytics and Artificial IntelligenceMS Information Technology and Management\\nView all posts by Kristine Imherr\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Podcast\\nbyGlenda Vosburgh- May 8th, 2023 -Academics,Events\\nMore than 500 students from 51 universities across the United States recently converged on the campus ofThe University of Texas at Dallasfor theEnactus USA National Expositionhosted this year by theNaveen Jindal School of Management.\\nEnactus is a network of leaders using business to make a positive social and environmental impact. Teams of students, guided by educators and supported by business leaders, are tasked with conducting needs assessments in their communities, identifying potential solutions to complicated issues, and implementing community impact projects.\\nThe organization is comprised of more than 37,000 students from more than 2,000 campuses in 33 countries. It holds an annual series of regional and national competitions in which teams of students showcase their projects. They are evaluated by global business leaders.\\nDr. Hasan Pirkul, Caruth Chair and Jindal School dean, welcomed the audience at the April 19-21 event which was hosted by the Jindal School’s MS Business Analytics Flex program in conjunction with the UT Dallas chapter of Enactus. As hosts, the chapter did not compete this year.\\nTeams in the 2023 national expositions, such as the Jindal School event, compete to be named national champion. Those teams from each country travel to theEnactus World Cupcompetition to vie for the title of Enactus World Champion. That competition is held in a different location every year. In 2023, it will be Oct. 17-20 in Utrecht, Netherlands.\\nIn the World Cup Qualifier competition, projects can be at any stage in the project. The winning team at the JSOM event was Brigham Young University–Hawaii. Second-place honors went to the University of Texas at Austin and Southern Adventist University took third.\\nThe Early-Stage Competition recognizes teams with projects in the early stages of development and provides feedback aimed at promoting the growth of the projects. Early-Stage teams were judged on their efforts to define a need, pursue entrepreneurial leadership, work toward positive impact, focus on long-term sustainability, and effectively communicate their project. Rutgers University was awarded first place. Second place went to Regent University and Valdosta State University took third place.\\nGaurav Shekhar, the faculty adviser forEnactus UT Dallas, an assistant professor of instruction in theInformation Systems Areaand director of the MS Business Analytics Flex and Online programs at the Jindal School, said hosting the national exposition is greatly beneficial for the school and for the students who visit from campuses across the United States.\\n“Jindal is a young school with some of the best programs in the world,” he said. “We are a leader in building sustainability and developing the future workforce. This event allows students from many different locations to become familiar with the Jindal School. It also provides an opportunity for our students to experience and get to know students from other places.”\\nOver the three-day event, teams participated in three rounds of competition for the World Cup and Early-Stage categories each. In addition to the ample opportunities for networking and making new friends, participants also were offered a career fair and a career services session.\\nZvia Schoenberg, Enactus United States president, said visiting different university campuses is an important benefit of the organization’s program.\\n“We want students to experience different campuses across the United States,” she said. “It is a valuable experience for them to be able to get to know other like-minded members.”\\nBringing the exposition to JSOM was a natural fit, according to Robyn Fehrman, Enactus Global CEO and president.\\n“We are a global network that uses business innovation to solve the world’s most pressing problems, and we are so excited to bring these students together at the Jindal School,” she said. “It really is the crossroads of entrepreneurship and sustainability.”\\nFehrman served as moderator of the Enactus Forum, featuring a panel of business leaders who took on a topic that many managers are grappling with, “The Future of Work.”\\nParticipants were Abby Thompson, practice group vice president at Robert Half; Roti Balogun, global head of talent for the Chase division of JPMorgan Chase and an Enactus alumnus; Monoj Jonna, co-founder and CEO of Ramped and an Enactus alumnus; and Richardson, Texas, Mayor Paul Voelker, who also is the CEO of TrenData Inc.\\n“Due to rapid changes in technology, accelerated by the pandemic, workplaces look different than they did five years ago,” Fehrman said.\\xa0“Businesses have already implemented changes and more are likely to come.”\\nShe quizzed panel members on a range of topics, including their advice for success to students who will soon enter the workforce. Their responses included using the power of a network, being authentic, having a strong digital presence; being able to demonstrate a level of servant leadership; and getting involved in a passion project.\\nThe trend of flexible work hours or the ability to work remotely that launched during the pandemic out of necessity is likely here to stay, Thompson said. “(They) are the future for those who are suited to it.”\\nPanel members were also asked what the most important skills or most critical competencies are for now as well as the future workplace.\\n“Critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and innovative agility are all critical skills,” said Balogun, “but adaptability covers it all.”\\nJonna agreed. “Adaptability is important,” he said, “and you must have the ability to assess what you are good at and what the world needs. You also should be willing to learn new things.”\\nHost sponsors for the exposition were KPMG and Rich’s. Activity sponsors were Enterprise Holdings, Menasha, Anderson Merchandisers and ARCA Continental Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages.\\n“I’m sad that this is ending,” Shekhar said to the audience in closing the exposition. “This has been like an amusement park you don’t want to leave. We have had 500-600 new friends on our campus. And I am most grateful that our tomorrow is safe because you are working on it now.”']},\n",

All JSOM students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that demonstrates the highest standards of integrity and professionalism. JSOM has established a mandatory code of conduct and ethics policy for students. Failure to follow the policy guidelines will result in significant negative consequences as outlined below.\\nRepresent yourself accurately.\\nCommunicate an accurate and truthful representation of your academic and professional accomplishments, skills, and work authorization to employers on your application materials, resume and throughout the interview and recruitment process.\\nMaintain your commitment to the employer.\\nStudents are expected to fulfill their commitment to attend a scheduled in-person, phone or video interview and to interview genuinely. A verbal, written, email, text or other communication that expresses your acceptance of an internship or job offer is a commitment. Upon acceptance of the offer, cancel any upcoming interviews, withdraw pending applications, and notify other employers that you are no longer a candidate. Note that reneging (backing out) of an internship/job offer is unprofessional and damages not only your professional reputation but also the university. Finally, follow through with your commitment to the established work schedule and the start and end dates of employment. Quitting a job or internship early or unexpectedly has negative consequences for the employer.\\nComplete work responsibilities in an ethical manner.\\nNote that violating company policies, engaging in Illegal activities or inappropriate/unprofessional behavior may result in employment termination in addition to the JSOM Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy consequences.\\nConsequences for Failure to Follow and to Meet the JSOM Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy\\nYou will be removed from the hireJSOM powered by Handshake recruiting portal and lose JSOM Career Management Center privileges for a period of at least one year.\\nYou will receive a course failure for your internship course and/or CPT internship course.

The JSOM students there were also very intellectual and curious. It was a great educational experience.\\nTurning Adversity into Achievement: Abinav Bayya’s Academic Transformation\\nAbinav Bayya came to the Naveen Jindal School of Management to pursue his Master of Science in Supply Chain Management. After a turbulent first semester, Bayya found himself on academic probation.\\nLester Dsouza, Class of ’21\\nFinancial Analyst at CBRE\\nDuring my research for a good graduate school, I saw that the MS in Finance at JSOM offered more than just quality education, it provided an access to huge knowledge pool and experience from the faculties and the peers alike. It had the widely diverse class with students from all around the world to learn from, while having 200+ student organizations to develop myself outside of the classroom and make friends. Being located really close to Dallas, a major city which has great opportunities also influenced my decision to enroll at JSOM.\\nGaurav Sethi, BS’20\\nInvestment Bank Risk Analyst,JP Morgan\\nJP Morgan\\nSethi works at JP Morgan as a specialist in counterparty credit risk calculations, doing the heavy analysis that most don’t even know exists – he investigates and explains derivative exposure variances and changes. Sethi earned both finance and actuarial science undergrad degrees. (Actuarial science is in the UT Dallas School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.) Notably, Sethi was awarded the prestigious $15,000 Mitchell Family Foundation Scholar Award from the Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation, based on his work with CampusOven, a service that connects university employees and students with caterers who are focused on healthy eating options.\\nAndrew Joseph Limas, BS’19\\nAssistant Language Teacher,RCS Japan\\nRCS Japan\\nAfter graduating from Jindal School with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, Limas signed up with RCS Corporation Japan, a staffing company based in Tokyo that finds English teachers for local schools. The company placed him in a job in Tokyo, where Limas now works as an assistant language teacher. In his role, he shares language skills with his students along with information about American culture and traditions. He credits opportunities to work on start-up business ideas at the Jindal School with expanding his understanding about how businesses work.\\nIan Martinez, Class of ’21\\nDVC informatics Analyst at Houlihan Lokey\\nI chose my MS degree in Finance at JSOM primarily because of the curriculum and the faculty staff. The courses taught covered all of the areas in finance and it gave the opportunity to specialize in different concentrations, such as financial technology or investment analysis. Additionally, the faculty is very well prepared and up to date in the latest research.\\nAbhishek Sharma, Class of ’21\\nFinance Manager at Amazon\\nMy background experience was a mix of technical qualifications as a software engineer and work experience as a futures trader and Sales Finance Manager. Even though I had worked in the finance domain in different capacities, I didn’t have experience of academic finance and when looking for options for my graduate level education my priority was to complement both my previous education and work experience. The MS Finance program at JSOM not only fulfilled all the criteria but also boasted of world class faculty and a very enhanced learning program and facilities.']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- October 15th, 2024 -Development,Events,Students\\nA packed house attended the Jindal School’s 2024 Scholarship Breakfast. The event is the school’s largest fundraiser.\\nAs the key fundraiser for theNaveen Jindal School of Management, the 2024 edition of the annualScholarship Breakfast, held Oct. 9, highlighted the profound impact of scholarships on student success and featured an announcement of a new endowed scholarship by a successful alumnus.\\nKeynote speakerDr. Sulman Ahmed, BS’01, founder, chairman and CEO ofDECA Dental Group, popularly known as Ideal Dental, shared the story of his journey from humble beginnings in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to the U.S. and finally to Dallas, where he ultimately enrolled in the business administration program at UTD. He credited this experience with helping prepare him for his successful dental practice chain.\\nAhmed offered advice related to his winding journey to success to the audience, which included dozens of JSOM students who are scholarship recipients.\\n“You never know how life will unfold and your dreams will manifest themselves,” he said. “You just don’t always. Keep learning, even from your failures. It prepares you for the future. It always takes longer than you think. It’s not a race. This is something I am still learning today.”\\nJohn Barden, a clinical professor in the Jindal School and dean ofExecutive Education, served as the emcee for the event which was held at the Davidson Gundy Alumni Center. He opened the festivities by announcing that the Jindal School’s development efforts had resulted in more than $30 million in scholarship funding between 2014 and 2024. Roughly 9,100 students have benefitted from this fundraising, with an average of $3,200 of support per recipient.\\nDr. Hasan Pirkul, Caruth Chair and Jindal School dean, welcomed the special guests, including Ahmed; his wife Dr. Julie M. Covino; Dr. Richard C. Benson, UT Dallas, president; Dr. Inga Musselman, UTD vice president for academic affairs and provost, Dr. Kyle Edgington, UTD vice president for development and alumni relations; Dr. Rafael Martín, UTD vice president and chief of staff; and Dr. Calvin Jamison, UTD vice president for facilities and economic development.\\nPirkul then updated the audience on new developments at JSOM.\\n“It is safe to say that we are always among the top 10 to 15 public business schools in the nation,” he said. “So we are doing very well on that front.”\\nHe shared that the Jindal School continues to dominate in research productivity rankings, as demonstrated in theUTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings™, which he helped create. The Jindal School was ranked No. 20 in the first edition, released in 2005.\\n“Fast forward to today, we are No. 2 in the world,” he said. “Financial Times, which uses twice as many journals, 51 journals, I believe, also does a ranking, and they think we are No. 6 in the world.”\\nFinally, he shared the news about an expansion of the Jindal School’s physical footprint on the UT Dallas campus. The day before the Scholarship Breakfast, he and other UTand JSOM leadershad donned hardhats and had plunged their shovels into the ground at the groundbreaking ceremony.\\n“Yes, we are building a new building, a third building in our complex — the Jindal School Complex,” he announced. He described his favorite part of the addition, a 125,000 sq. ft. structure known as JSOM III that will house Executive Education and the undergraduate programs.\\n“My favorite part of the design is a large courtyard that has ample shaded space, trees and has ample seating,” he said. “(It has) water features — so think of a Zen place and our students, our faculty, our staff will be able to sit in an environment that’s peaceful, interact with each other, talk (and) create. Our current facilities are great, but we lacked such a space and so I’m glad that we are able to include it in this building.”']},\n",

Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia — you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule. The typical research faculty teaches three or four classes a year and spends the remaining time working on research.\\nTo truly be successful in a PhD program, you must be passionate about research. PhD programs are time-consuming and can be stressful, and you need to love what you are doing to succeed. If you dream about a career devoted to research and teaching, a PhD is for you.\\nJSOM is the perfect environment to begin your research career, with outstanding faculty mentors, a low student to faculty ratio and a commitment to research excellence. Full-time students receive a research fellowship early in their stay at UTD that allows them to get a heads tart on their research career.\\nMore from PhD Resource Articles\\nWhy choose JSOM for my PhD?\\nThe University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.\\nWhat makes a perfect PhD programs applicant?\\nGetting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.\\nWhat’s it like to be a PhD student?\\nWill I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus?

International students can apply for loans, but they need a credit-worthy co-signer who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident who resides in the United States. UT Dallas does not have its own loan program. If you would like to pursue a private education loan, you will need to select a lender and apply directly. While UT Dallas may be asked by the lender to confirm you are a student, the University is not otherwise involved in the process and cannot recommend any lender. Additional information can be found on the Office of Financial Aid’sPrivate Education Loanspage.\\nIt depends on the type of scholarship. If it says in the terms and conditions that the scholarship is not “stackable,” then you may not apply for another scholarship that counts toward in-state tuition.

In addition, there are fewer opportunities for visa sponsorship into full-time jobs for international students.\\nWe have seen sponsorship occur more frequently in the following situations:\\nThe student is pursuing an analytics track.\\nThe student is pursuing the Product Management Track and earned an undergraduate degree in engineering or the sciences.\\nIn both cases, a high degree of written and oral proficiency is required, and usually, the student’s TOEFL score needs to be above a 95. Marketing is about writing and speaking with proficiency.\\nApproximately 60% of our MS in Marketing students are international students. Many of these students have one to several years of experience in different areas of marketing, such as advertising, marketing analytics or consumer insights. Because MS MKT is now a STEM program, eligible F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees may apply for a 24-month STEM OPT extension to their original 12-month OPT for a potential total of 36 months of OPT. For more information, please go to theInternational Students and Scholars Officewebsite.\\nMS Marketing Career Outcomes\\nUT Dallas has a student services department that helps international students with such issues.

Regarding level of difficulty both exams are very similar and this determination can be highly subjective. We suggest you compare them by checking out from the library GRE and GMAT prep books and/or see what other students have to say.\\nCareer, Internship and Job Placements - MS ITM FAQ\\nInternational students are eligible to work on a curricular internship for a maximum of 12 months while they are still students in the program. Further, since the MS ITM is an approved degree under the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) program, the graduating students are eligible to work for up to 36 months under the Optional Practical Training program. Please contact theOffice of International Student Servicesfor details about these programs.\\nYes. You can decide how many credits you want to take as a part of your internship. You can take a 3 semester credit hour internship as long as it meets certain requirements which the Program Director determines on a case by case basis, considering factors such as duties, duration, direct manager and company involved. Domestic students must have completed one long semester and international students, two long semesters before they can take an internship for credit. A maximum of 3 semester credit hours for the internship can count towards completing the Master’s program.\\nAn internship or an applied, practice-based class is a mandatory requirement for graduation. In the last academic year, students in the MS ITM program worked on more than400internships for 200 different employers. In addition, the program offers a Digital Consulting class where local employers provide students in the class with projects to work on. Students have a choice to complete an internship, the digital consulting class or complete both. For students currently working, a project or experience from their existing employer may be used to satisfy the internship requirement.\\nFall 2021 – Average wage – $26.09, 75 internships\\nSpring 2022 – Average wage – $28.05, 73 internships\\nGraduates with a Master of Science degree in Information Technology (IT) and Management find positions such as business analyst, consultant, program analyst, database administrator, IT project manager and IT specialist, depending on prior experience. They are employed in every conceivable industry, including consulting, financial services, retail, energy, transportation and consumer goods. Most companies have a well-defined career path for their IT professionals. The typical top-level positions within the IT function of a firm include chief information officer (CIO), chief security officer (CSO), partner, senior vice president and director of technology.']},\n",

Grady Spruce High School, 2019\\nAt UT Dallas:\\nSophomore in Accounting\\nIf you work off campus, are there things you’ve learned at UTD that you apply at work?\\nI am part of the environmental services at UT Southwestern. Thanks to some of my Jindal School classes, I have been able to understand how management works on a much larger scale and see how inventory is managed.\\nWhat’s the best thing about UT Dallas and Jindal School so far?\\nI think the best thing has been learning and being able to understand how systems work. When I was kid, I would always wonder how and where businesses would get large amounts of food or supplies and how they would keep track of it all when there were at least 100 items on every order. Understanding the infrastructure of companies has been the thing I have been intrigued with most. Jindal School classes have been answering those questions.\\nHow have your personal goals changed since you’ve been at UT Dallas?\\nMy idea/goal when I got here was that I would be here for four years and get my degree. But now I see that these four years are for me to better myself.\\nMore from Scholars at Jindal School\\nOscar Urrutia\\nAt UT Dallas:Junior in Healthcare ManagementWhat's the most surprising thing about being in college?The most surprising aspect of college is the amount of new information you learn in one hour when you go to class. There’s so much to process and that forces you to ask questions in order to understand the topic. This is critical to your development, since asking questions will enhance your understanding of objectives and the task at hand.What is a class you enjoy and why?I am enjoying Medical Terminology. The information I have learned has been fascinating. If I decide to pursue a career in a hospital setting, knowing medical terms will allow me to better interact with doctors and staff, while also making good decisions that support the hospital.What is a class that was particularly hard that, in the end, you mastered?The hardest class I have taken so far was Financial Accounting. If you have never taken anything related to accounting, the course gets really difficult really quickly. In all honesty, it took me a while to find a way to comprehend this class, but I developed new study habits and began solving practice problems to get better at recognizing different accounting scenarios. I finished the class with a good grade and with the relief knowing I was done with it.\\nJunior in Healthcare Management\\nWhat's the most surprising thing about being in college?\\nThe most surprising aspect of college is the amount of new information you learn in one hour when you go to class.

His gift, together with that of fellow alumni Charles and Nancy Davidson, created a philanthropic package valued, with matching funds, at $45 million. The University of Texas Board of Regents recognized his philanthropy by naming the school the Naveen Jindal School of Management.\\n“My vision and desire,” Jindal said, “is that the [Jindal] School of Management becomes the school of choice for some of the brightest and best individuals who will truly lead us into the next generation, leaders who will truly embrace the global vision and balance the needs of the people with the environment in an ethical and sustainable manner.”\\nIn memory of his late father, Naveen Jindal founded and is chancellor of the O.P. Jindal Global University (JGU) in Haryana, India. JGU has eight schools: art and architecture, banking and finance, business, government and public policy, international affairs, journalism and communication, law and liberal arts and humanities.\\nJindal’s business career has roots in the O.P. Jindal Group, a multibillion-dollar family conglomerate. He serves as chairman ofJindal Steel and Power Limited, a steel manufacturer that has diversified into cement production, mining, oil and gas and power generation.\\nA national record holder in India for skeet shooting and an adept polo player, Jindal found another passion while at UT Dallas — politics. He served first as Student Government vice president and then president, at the same time earning the Student Leader of the Year Award.\\nInspired by displays of the U.S. flag on campus, he later successfully challenged India’s Flag Code, which allowed the banner to be put on view only on special occasions. The effort led him to found the Flag Foundation of India and birthed his parliamentary career. He served two five-year terms in the Lok Sabha, Parliament’s lower house. Besides education, his public and private development initiatives have focused on healthcare, infrastructure, women’s empowerment and youth.\\nIn 2023, Jindal returned to UT Dallas as one of the university’s most accomplished alumni, noted as a global leader in industry, a statesman in his home country of India, an advocate for human rights and a record-holding sportsman. He was presented with the University’s Lifetime Achievement Award.\\nAt the Awards Gala, Jindal said receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award renewed his commitment to making a difference in the world. “For me, this award is not just a recognition of my past accomplishments, but a call to action for the future,” Jindal said. “There is still so much work to be done, but I believe we all have a responsibility to use our talents and resources to make the world a better place.”']},\n",

All the first-, second- and third-place finishers were freshmen.\\nAmong the competitors, 20 wereNaveen Jindal School of Managementstudents. Half the JSOM students placed in the top 10, and five of them finished in the top three.\\nCarola Del Castillo, a marketing major, and Karla Trujillo, a business administration major, landed first place in marketing communications. Mayank Nakra, a double-major in finance and economics, and Sonika Rao, a finance major, took second place in business ethics. Roshni Shah, healthcare management; Hannah Lee, biochemistry; and Emily Nguyen, biology; took third place in business research.\\n“It was incredible how our newest members took to the organization,” said Dheera Dammanna, president of the UT Dallas chapter of DECA, which is based in the Jindal School. “They were ready to be leaders very quickly.”\\nDammanna, a senior in biology and healthcare management, had a top-10 finish at the Orlando conference, working as an individual in the Business Research category.\\nDECA is a business-preparation club with a major focus on improving students’ knowledge in entrepreneurism, finance, hospitality, management and marketing. According to the DECA website, its college division has more than 15,000 members on 250 campuses worldwide.\\nTom Henderson, assistant dean of undergraduate programs at JSOM and advisor to the 118-member DECA chapter, said it is a part of the Jindal School’s philosophy to get students involved right away. “We respect what our students bring early on,” he said. “We offer these organizations for students to be active — not to wait around until they’re juniors to be successful. I was so proud of them.”\\nDammanna, who graduated May 16, found the conference competition a rewarding end to her time as chapter president. (Sonika Rao was recently elected to succeed her as chapter president for the 2019-2020 academic year.) “The topic I had was to conduct a multigenerational evaluation of a company,” Dammanna said. “I was able to see the inner workings of a small firm in the area and had a big focus on employment-retention strategies and formulating a plan to improve that. I wrote a 15-page paper and gave a 20-minute presentation in competition.”\\nDammanna, who has been accepted into JSOM’s Full-Time MBA program, believes this kind of experience will serve her well in the future. “This competition brings out your best,” she said. “I see that I can take these skills to many places — and there’s still room to improve!”\\nBS Business AdministrationBS FinanceBS Healthcare ManagementBS Marketing\\nView all posts by Eric Butterman\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

              "  'chunks': ['I have to do a video interview; what do I do?\\nVirtual interviewing can be live or “on-demand” (recorded), and when you’re invited to complete one, the company will typically include instructions. Make sure you have a high quality camera and microphone, and be prepared to wear a business suit. Utilize the InterviewStream tool to practice behavioral interview questions, register for our workshop on video interviewing, and set up an appointment with a JSOM CMC Career Development Specialist to learn more.\\nWhat questions (and how many?) should I ask in an interview?\\nBe prepared to ask 3 questions.  You may not have time for all three if time doesn’t allow but you will prepared if you do have the time.  Ask questions which demonstrate that you have researched and thought about this company. For example: I have read about the X initiative and that it will impact your company. Can you tell me more about it and how it relates to the work that your team is doing?  Here is a link to asample list of 33 possible questions.\\nWhat should I put on the application when it asks for my desired salary?\\nResearch industry trends, check UTD program website for salary information, LaunchMyCareertx.org, Glassdoor.com, Indeed.com/salary, PayScale.com, Salary.com, BLS.gov. Use these resources to determine a salary range to put in the application.\\nI have been invited to interview; how do I prepare?\\nPrepare S.T.A.R. stories based on the job description, and practice behavioral interview questions using theQuinnciatool. Additionally, think about how to answer questions like “Tell me about yourself” and “Why should we hire you?”. These types of questions should be answered by giving a brief (60 seconds) explanation of who you are, what you’re doing now at UTD, and how your career goals align with the company and the job for which you are applying. You should also make an appointment with a JSOM CMC Career Development Specialist in Handshake, and register for our job interview workshops.\\nWhat if I contact someone through LinkedIn or email and they don’t respond back?\\nWait two weeks and contact again.  If after that the person still doesn’t respond, move on to another contact.  Be patient for a response and be professional in all correspondence for best results.\\nI have applied for hundreds of jobs but haven’t heard back. What am I doing wrong?\\nFor job applications, focus on quality not quantity. Tailor every resume and cover letter in your application process. Study the job description and make sure you are applying for jobs where you match the experience the company is seeking.  Use the job description to highlight specific skills that are listed. Lastly, either start networking or ramp up your networking as it is often the key to getting past the application to the interview invitation.\\nCan I just apply for a job without networking if I concentrate on a large volume of applications?\\nOn average, every corporate job opening attracts 250 applicants. Since this is an average, it must also be true that for some jobs, there will be more that 250 applicants. Networking can help you to get singled out of the applicant pack to get invited to an interview.  Networking is essential in the job hunt. It seems complicated, but really it means talking to others about your job search and career goals. You are not networking to ask for a job. Networking helps you learn information about jobs that are being created, jobs that are “hidden” because they never get posted, and jobs that may not be currently open but will be posted in the future.\\nHow do I start to Network?\\nMake a list of people who might be able to help answer your job search questions:  Friends, family, neighbors, community group members, classmates, teachers, professors, advisors, coaches, alumni plus referrals from other contacts.  Start talking to them.  Remember you are not asking for a job, you are gathering information about businesses, industries, events, advice, share ideas, and referrals.\\nHow can I find places to network?\\nA good place to start is LinkedIn groups, local Meetups (meetup.com), events sponsored by professional associations or chamber of commerce, conferences, alumni association meetings, and Handshake.\\nShould I include references with my cover letter?\\nNo, references are provided when the company requests them of a candidate.\\nHow long should my letter be?\\nOne page only.\\nWhat is everything I should include in a cover letter?\\nHow you heard about the job, how you meet the requirements of the job, how does your experience relate to this position, why you are interested in the job.  Keep the tone of your letter optimistic and show your motivation to excel.\\nCan I just make a template of my cover letter and send with my resume since the types of positions to which I am applying are very similar?\\nEach letter should be tailored to the employer and include at least one paragraph revealing your knowledge of the company and how you can bring your experience and skillset to the employer.\\nI don’t have any experience; how do I fix that on my résumé?\\nAs a student, part of your experience may be gained from student activities/clubs, academic projects and volunteer efforts.  Join organizations and volunteer to begin to build experiences which can demonstrate, communications skills, teamwork, leadership and project management.\\nWhy is a cover letter necessary?\\nA cover letter should always be sent with your resume.  The cover letter tells your why you want to work for the company and tailors your experience to the position for which you are applying.  In addition, you are telling a little about who you are as a candidate that is different from what is on your resume.']},\n",

If you receive an offer for another country, you will need work authorization for that country, either as a local citizen or by applying through the employer. Contact International Education at educationabroad@utdallas.edu for more information prior to making any travel plans. If you leave the U.S., remember to let ISSO know.\\nHow many hours may I work under CPT?

In large companies, the role has been supplanted by specialists, such as those in digital marketing, marketing analytics, customer insights, mobile marketing and  other departments. In some firms, the role is combined with sales management. However, small and medium firms still use marketing managers, particularly if the company does not have the budget to hire specialists. In some companies, marketing managers may oversee specialists.What is the size of the marketing manager job market?Because it encompasses many roles, it is significantly larger than highly specialized areas such as Customer Insights. A Glassdoor.com search provided nearly 90,000 marketing manager job listings in the United States. Searches on Indeed.com and LinkedIn returned more listings — more than 130,000 — but many of those were for digital, SEO, and analytics jobs. Those specialties are covered in the Digital Marketing & Analytics track description.Average years of experience and salary averageWith one  to three years of experience, a marketing manager can expect to earn in the range of$50,000a year. As always, seniority provides greater compensation. With three to five years of experience, that salary jumps to$80,673. When a marketing professional has over 10 years of experience, that can translate into salaries in the range of$150,000or more, particularly on the East and West Coasts and with larger companies.Source:Indeed.comSource:Glassdoor.comTypical job descriptionFrom a job posting for Senior Associate Marketing Manager, Loyalty Programs, Essilor, DallasPrimary Responsibility:The Sr. Associate Marketing Manager, Channel Programs, will be responsible for ensuring all strategic and project-related activities for Essilor loyalty programs delivered in an accurate and timely manner.

              "  'chunks': ['Groves grew up on a farm in Ohio and witnessed his father’s heartache when his brother — 20 years older than Toby — was convicted of bank fraud in 1986.\\n“On a Sunday morning my dad opened the newspaper, and there’s my brother’s picture and a headline saying he’d been charged with massive bank fraud. I found my dad doubled over, sobbing. I thought he’d had a heart attack.\\n“My father said to me, ‘Promise me that you will never get in any trouble like this,’ ” Groves said. “And I swore to him that I wouldn’t.”\\nYet, about 20 years later, Groves appeared before the same judge as his brother, being sentenced to prison for the same crime.\\nWhen he got out, he set about to learn about the psychology of fraud.\\n“I had thought that I understood fraud, but that was an illusion,” he said. “I was overconfident, and it led me to a bad place. When I faced challenges, I tried to save my reputation — fix a problem before anyone could find out about it. Looking back, it is clear that I was worried about what other people would think of me.”\\nGroves currently is completing his PhD in psychology and speaks to audiences across the U.S. on the topic of the psychology of fraud. His story has been shared on a number of media outlets including National Public Radio and in numerous professional journals, and it is studied by leading researchers and business schools.\\nHis book, Lenses, based on his experiences on the speaker’s tour with his late son, who was autistic, is expected to be released next spring. It was his son who challenged him to become a speaker.\\n“He told me that if I really believed everything I’d been saying about the psychology of fraud I would be a hypocrite if I didn’t talk about,” Groves said “I never wanted to be a speaker, but now I love it.”\\nDr. Mark Nigrini\\nWorkplace fraudsters often share certain surprising characteristics, said Dr. Mark Nigrini, whose keynote address and workshop at the UT Dallas Fraud Summit will focus on Forensics Analytics and Employee Fraud.\\n“They are usually among the nicest people in the office, and every time they are found out, people say they never would have suspected them of doing that,” Nigrini said in a recent telephone interview. “In addition, they are usually in a position of trust at a company and, in all of the cases we deal with, about half the time, gambling is involved.”\\nNigrini, who is best known for his work on using Benford’s law as an auditing and accounting tool to detect anomalies in company data, is the author of Forensic Analytics: Methods and Techniques for Forensic Accounting Investigations (Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons, 2011), which describes tests to detect fraud, errors, estimates, and biases in financial data and of Benford’s law.\\nBenford’s law provides the expected patterns of the digits in the numbers in tabulated data, such as towns and city populations, or fake portfolio returns.\\nNigrini’s workshop and his keynote address will focus on understanding the fingerprints of fraud numbers. He uses real-life examples and describes the program as entertaining and educational.\\n“In one of the cases that we discuss in the workshop, a man gambled away $6 million at a casino,” he said. “How do you gamble away $6 million and think that it’s a good thing to do? He got caught when his ex-wife made a comment to someone at lunch about how she couldn’t understand how he keeps winning at the casino. He had told her he was winning.\\nParticipants in Nigrini’s workshop also discuss ways that fraudulent numbers differ from good numbers.\\n“For example,” he said, “fraudsters enjoy using round numbers. We talk about multiples of 1,000 or 1 million. Fraudsters also usually show excessive growth. If an organization is growing by 4 percent, a fraudster might say it’s growing by 40 percent.”\\nFraud, he said, is an equal-opportunity employer.\\n“When it comes to committing crimes in general, women tend to be more law-abiding then men,” he said. “But when it comes to fraud, the number [of offenders] is split about 50/50 between men and women.”\\nNigrini’s forensic work has been referenced in national media, including The Financial Times, The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, and he has been featured in numerous radio and TV interviews, including on NBC and the Investigation Discovery Channel.\\nAccountingCenter for Internal Auditing Excellence\\nView all posts by Glenda Vosburgh\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyJeanne Spreier- February 9th, 2016 -College Knowledge\\nContents\\nStep 1: Decide which platform you’re going to use.\\nStep 2: Determine your budget.\\nStep 5: Set aside time to put your online yearbook together.\\nStep 6: Order your first try\\nYearbooks are so last century so you should create your own yearbook with anonline photo book. Really. Most schools have gotten out of the yearbook business completely as online platforms for making your own, 100 percent meaningful yearbook is so easy. Most photo book platforms will allow you to upload your photos, and then their software will sort them by date, slap them in pages and call it done (in less than five minutes). But most people want to do a little more customization. Here are tips to get you started:\\nThe photo book review is one of many places that rate the online photo book companies, as is thePhoto Book Girl blog. Keep checking around. One thing you may want (“I can pick it up in a couple hours”) may override the benefits of another service (“I can have a matte finish on pages”).\\nThis seems obvious, but you might want to do old-school pencil and paper calculations. All DIY online photo books come with a predetermined number of “free” pages included in the basic book price. Each time you add an additional page to your book beyond that number, the price goes up — sometimes quickly. Adding certain features (lay-flat binding, for instance) also will increase the cost. Know what you can afford to spend and what’s really important to you.\\nStep 3: Organization matters.\\nDo you want your photo book to be about just one semester? That may be a good idea for a semester abroad. Or do you want one yearbook for the entire academic year, organized chronologically — what happened in September first and what happened in May last? Or you might do a book per topic — everything that happened in your sorority or fraternity in one book; everything that happened at your ball games in another. It’s important to know what will — and won’t — go into your yearbook before you even start.\\nStep 4: Gather your photos.\\nThis could take the longest. You’ll be looking through thousands of photos on Instagram, your phone, your friends’ Facebook pages, maybe even getting some photos from your mom. (It seemed silly when she was taking photos of you moving into your apartment, but now you’d like some of those.) Here are pro tips:\\nSet up folders for your photos, whether you’re doing by event (sporting events, sorority happenings, dorm life) or by calendar (September, October, etc.).\\nGet the largest file of the photo you can. “Click, save” gets a Facebook-sized photo. It will be small in your photo book because it will have low resolution — no one wants pixilated photos in their yearbook! To get the largest file you can off Facebook, click on the photo, click on the Options tab on the toolbar, bottom right; then click Download.']},\n",

During the Young Scholars Workshop, the group will consist of several breakout sessions and a plenary session. At the plenary session, Professor of Operations Bradley Staats of the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School will give a presentation.\\nBradley Staats\\nProfessor of Operations at the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School (United States of America)\\nPresentation: The Promise and Peril of Field Experiments\\nField experiments are controlled interventions in the real world that enable researchers to measure the effects of a treatment on a randomly assigned subset of subjects. In this talk I will discuss review the advantages and disadvantages of field experiments and provide some practical prescriptions to attain and evaluate a field experiment’s relevance—in other words, the theoretical implications of understanding the effects of the treatment— and rigor, based on many methodological considerations.\\nBiography\\nDr. Bradley R. Staats is a professor at the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School and best-selling author ofNever Stop Learning: Stay Relevant, Reinvent Yourself, and Thrive. His research and teaching focus on learning and analytics. He advises individuals and organizations on how to learn and improve in order to innovate and succeed on an ongoing basis. In addition, he leads UNC’s Center for the Business of Health, a cross-campus, interdisciplinary effort to tackle the most pressing challenges in health care.\\nDr. Staats integrates work in operations management and human behavior to understand how and under what conditions individuals, teams and organizations can perform their best. His field-based research in such settings as health care and software services, consulting, call centers and retail, uses archival data and field experiments to provide an interdisciplinary perspective to improve both operations’ theory and practice.\\nHe publishes frequently in both leading academic journals and practitioner-focused journals. He is an associate editor at Management Science, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management and Production and Operations Management.\\nHe received his DBA in technology and operations management and MBA from Harvard Business School. He received his BS with honors in electrical engineering and his BA with high honors in Plan II and Spanish from The University of Texas at Austin.\\nConference Schedule\\nThe conference will begin with a welcome drink on Sunday evening and continue with a one-day Young Scholars Workshop on Monday, July 8, and the main conference on Tuesday and Wednesday, July 9-10.\\nAssociate Professor for Behavioral Economics at University of Leuven (Belgium)\\nPresentation: Lessons from Behavioral and Experimental Economics in Health Economics\\nAs long ago as 1963, Nobel prize winner Kenneth J. Arrow argued in an article with almost 9,000 citations that the market for health care differs from other markets. Consumers usually do not face the full price of the goods and services they consume, since at least part of the price is paid for by insurance companies. In addition, consumers have limited information and thus have to trust the recommendation of an expert, the physician. The behavior of physicians, on its turn, is governed by professional norms. In this setting, many important insights into the market have been brought forward by behavioral and experimental economists. This keynote provides an overview on some of the most important findings from behavioral economics as well as some of the most famous experiments in health economics, and it discusses the main features, advantages and limitations as well as the quo vadis of these types of experiments.\\nIris Kesternich is Associate Professor for Behavioral Economics at the Department of Economics at the University of Leuven. Her research focuses on incentives and the interaction of market participants in health and labor markets. She is specifically interested in the influence of non-monetary incentives and social preferences on decision-making in these domains. In a current sequence of projects she analyzes the effects of the meaning of work on labor supply; the influence of professional norms on medical decision making; and the role of social preferences in situations with concentrated benefits and dispersed costs.\\nIris Kesternich obtained a Ph.D. in economics in 2010 from the University of Munich, and she had a position there as postdoctoral researcher until September 2014. Over the last few years she was a visiting scholar at a number of institutions such as Boston University, Harvard Health Care Policy, Harvard Kennedy School, and the Harvard Center of Population and Development Studies. She is Associate Editor of the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, a member of the board of the German Society for Health Economics (dggö), a resident visitor at the RAND Corporation, and Research Associate at the Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research in Mannheim (ZEW); and she is affiliated to the Behavioral Experiments in Health Network.\\nProfessor of Operations Management and Logistics at Kuehne Logistics University (Germany)\\nPresentation: Behavioral Operations: Creating context to venture into new fields\\nWhile the research on behavioral operations originated primarily in the field of manufacturing as less rigorous field work, and then developed into more formal experimental work in the laboratory focusing on general operations management problems, further growth of the field and new exciting problems are awaiting us by venturing into new major research problems. I will give an overview of some early work in some areas addressed by the broader OM literature, such as in humanitarian operations and healthcare. I will conclude by addressing how behavioral OM could leapfrog the broader OM by contributing to some of the societal challenges ahead, in particular relating to the future of work.\\nJan C. Fransoo is Professor of Operations Management & Logistics at Kuehne Logistics University in Hamburg, Germany. He also serves as the University’s Dean of Research and Member of the Executive Board. He joined KLU in 2018 following a tenure of 22 years at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, where he still holds a courtesy professorship in its School of Industrial Engineering.

Speakers explored how AI is reshaping business — and how essential it is for board members to take the lead in its responsible implementation.\\nDr. Hasan Pirkul, Caruth Chair and Jindal School dean, was in attendance and welcomed the audience, which numbered 125. He said that the AI sessions in the conference were crucial for the audience, composed mainly of corporate board members, for understanding how to use them properly in business.\\n“We are at the forefront,” he said. “I am an IT (information technology) guy. I went to business school for my doctorate… So, it is no wonder that our school is highly technology focused. And so last year when AI kind of exploded — generative AI exploded in everybody’s consciousness — there was a big discussion in the University on whether we should make it illegal to use… and I told my folks, I said, ‘Listen, I want you to use it and I want you to teach your students how to use it.’”\\nIn a session titled “AI Great Power Competition,” Igor Jablokov, CEO & Founder of Pryon, spoke about how AI is necessarily transforming business strategies and how boards can get a handle on decision-making processes related to AI. He was interviewed by David Kohl,IECG Advisory Boardmember and partner at Mangrove Investments.']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyGaby Arora- November 17th, 2015 -Jindal News & Events\\nThe Entrepreneurship Club at UT Dallas has been shaking things up lately. With new faculty members and classes added to the course catalog, the E Club has pushed the needle of innovation to the max. The club has even persuaded Mark Cuban to come back to UT Dallas to judge the Business Idea Competition this Friday. It’s a pretty big deal, and it’s got a lot of us excited about it — 900 registered guests as of last Wednesday to be exact.\\nAlong with Mark Cuban, there will be three other celebrity judges.

You’ll remember him as an investor on “Shark Tank,” the reality TV show “The Benefactor,” the owner of theDallas Mavsbasketball team and as a guest on “Dancing with the Stars”! If you’ve been summoned to guest dance on “DWTS,” that’s when you know you’ve made it big.\\nSecond up, we have Swapnil Bora, a JSOM alumnus and past winner of the Business Idea Competition. He was actually on “Shark Tank” with business partner Corey Egan a few years ago when Mark Cuban decided to invest into their company,ilumi, which makes a smart LED light that’s controlled through an app on your phone. That’s how Swapnil, Corey and Mark became business pals, and that’s how we got Cuban to come to campus again. Thanks, Swapnil!\\nThird #CelebJudge is Eve Mayor, the founder and CEO ofSocial Media Delivered. She has been ranked by Forbes as the fifth-most influential woman in social media, and her company is one of the most respected in the industry worldwide. Eve is known as @LinkedinQueen for her knowledge in leveraging LinkedIn for sales and recruiting. Watch out, Dr. Dover!\\nLast but not least, we have Lea Nesbit, who is currently the CEO and co-founder of Natural Dental Implants Inc., makers of the REPLICATE™ Non-surgical Tooth Replacement System, a 100 percent customized solution for single tooth replacement. Before Natural Dental Implants, she co-founded Lingualcare, Inc., a dental technology company that replaced the traditional braces with invisible braces. Lea has also been a mentor atHealth Wildcattersfor 2½ years now.\\nNow that I’ve introduced you to the #CelebJudges, I’ll give you a heads up of how the event will go down.

Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- October 25th, 2016 -Academics,Corporate,Students\\nBeing born into an entrepreneurial family is not a prerequisite for business and academic success, but it certainly helps Naveen Jindal School of Management graduate students Kiran Devaprasad, Brian Harris and Kamiar Kordi.\\nAll three come from entrepreneurial families and are on their way to achieving the same type of success that their relatives modeled for them.\\nThat success is about to include the distinction of earning Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation scholarships.\\nThe organization will honor scholarship recipients this year at an October 27 gala in San Antonio that will afford them the opportunity to rub elbows with business legends including Warren E. Buffet, one of the inductees this year into the Texas Business Hall of Fame.\\nThe Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation assists future business leaders through a scholarship program. This year, the UT Dallas scholarships are sponsored by the Mitchell Family Foundation. In years past, a single scholarship was awarded to a student from each of 25 participating Texas colleges and universities. This year marks the first time that up to three students from a single institution were eligible for the $15,000 award.\\n“For me, what planted the seed of entrepreneurship was being taught a sense of accomplishment,” Devaprasad said. “I realized that my father and uncle work hard, and their destiny was determined primarily by their own actions and not based on somebody else’s assessment of their worth.”\\nDevaprasad, who is pursuing dual degrees in the Executive MBA program and theMS in Innovation and Entrepreneurship program, will use his scholarship earnings to grow TraceIT — a startup he created with EMBA classmate William White. Their system tracks drivers and loads in the car- and truck-hauling industry.\\nThe proceeds from Harris’ scholarship will help expand Blanco Farms Exotic Mushrooms, a business that evolved from a hobby he developed while working as a fishing guide.\\n“If I were to offer someone advice, I would say that successful entrepreneurs don’t hesitate,” Harris said. “They take opportunities to make it real. Don’t just sit back and think about ideas. I grew some mushrooms, took them to a restaurant and put them in a chef’s hands. I found out their needs. That’s how I made it concrete.”\\nWanting to start a business the right way, Harris enrolled in theBS in Business Administration program, then the MS in Innovation and EntrepreneurshipFast-Track program. Then he enteredMSIE’s Startup Launch Track. This allowed him to test his concept. It was so successful that he was awarded $5,000 in seed funding. Now, the proceeds from his scholarship will help expand the business.\\nKordi’s parents had emigrated from Iran to Dallas and started an ice-cream truck business, He got to tag along from the age of six months, and as he grew older, he got more directly involved in the family business.\\nLike Devaprasad and Harris, Kordi, anMS in financemajor, ran with those early lessons. He started an organization as an undergraduate at Texas A&M University and spearheaded many more. The funding from his scholarship award will be used to start a couple of tech companies including a nonprofit, value-added organization with multiple services that facilitate voters’ involvement in the democratic process. Those services feature Policentric — a mobile app by which constituents can send correspondence to their representatives, monitor their replies and response rates, and check up on their legislation.\\n“The main purpose of Policentric app is to hold candidates accountable for the policy decisions they pursue,” said Kordi. “There’s so much anger in society that’s coming to a boiling point, and I wanted to provide a means by which voters can make decisions based on [rational thought] and logic rather than angry rhetoric.”\\nBS Business AdministrationInnovation & EntrepreneurshipInstitute for Innovation & EntrepreneurshipMS FinanceMS Innovation and Entrepreneurship']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- February 28th, 2025 -Faculty/Research\\nA team of researchers, including two from theNaveen Jindal School of Management, has found a way to improve the hiring process for the sales profession by using artificial intelligence.\\nDr. Howard DoverandDr. Khai Chiong, both from the Jindal School’sMarketing Area, and their co-authors won the Best Paper on AI & Marketing Award 2024 from theAmerican Marketing Associationfor “Can AI and AI-Hybrids Detect Persuasion Skills? Salesforce Hiring with Conversational Video Interviews.” Their co-authors are Dr. Ishita Chakraborty from the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Dr. K. Sudhir from Yale University. The article appears in the Jan.-Feb. 2025 issue of Marketing Science, one of the peer-reviewed academic journals tracked inThe UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings™.\\nThe study looks at how AI and AI-human hybrid models analyze video interviews and evaluate persuasion skills by analyzing words, tone and body language during interviews of candidates for sales positions. It concluded that AI-human hybrid models are the most cost-effective method, followed by AI alone. In contrast, human-only interviews are the least cost-effective in large-scale entry-level hiring.\\nChiong, an assistant professor in JSOM’s Marketing Area, said because business-to-business sales is an important employment sector for Jindal School students and there is high demand for skilled professionals in the B2B sales domain, he was inspired to look into AI and AI-human hybrid models for sales hiring.',\n",
              "   '“The Center has a lot of sales role-play video data that made it possible to study this domain,” he said. “We want to know how AI can be used to analyze conversational interview videos for cost-effective yet high-quality sales recruitment and training. Moreover, can human input improve on AI? When we started this project back in 2019, modelings of video data were still nascent, and we had to develop and learn new methodologies along the way.”\\nChiong said the research team feeds text, audio, and visual input into the AI model so that it can learn the importance of aspects of verbal and non-verbal communication between the buyer and seller such as hand gestures, body postures, interactivity, and the content of the conversation. The AI model uses these features to measure persuasion skills.\\nThe human-AI hybrid model works better than AI-only models, Chiong said, because humans can capture nuanced aspects like confidence and nervousness.\\n“Our current version of AI may find it hard to capture,” he said. “For example, humans seem to differentiate whether hand movements reflect innate enthusiasm or impatience and nervousness. Also, humans can capture these additional nuances from just the early stages of the interview.”\\nChiong said that AI models, on the other hand, especially the recent development of Large Language Models, are quite effective in transcribing the video to text accurately and capturing a salesperson’s qualities such as active listening, confidence, politeness, and the ability to be collaborative.\\nCurrent AI hiring models tend to focus on hard skills, which are specific, measurable, and often tied to keywords that match job descriptions. These are easily detected in résumés. Dover, a clinical professor in the Jindal School and director of its Center for Professional Sales, said that many companies use role-play — simulated scenarios during the hiring process to assess skills, decision-making ability, and behavior in real-time — to make hiring decisions.\\n“The industry tends to lean on role plays to assess sales talent,” he said. “The power here is in how we can use AI tools to score and predict hireability.”\\nChiong said persuasion skills are important in many jobs, not just in the sales profession.\\n“These soft skills cannot be easily screened through résumés,” he said. “This is the reason why the use of conversational videos to score interviews and predict abilities is the highlight of our study.”\\nSince AI models can inherit bias from training data or in the way it is programmed, which can lead to unfair or discriminatory hiring outcomes, the team took steps to minimize this risk.\\n“Our training sample was scored by a large panel of judges who were seasoned industry professionals,” Chiong said. “This panel is balanced in terms of gender. We also use statistical methods to remove potential confounding influences and biases from any particular judges or sellers. Our study would be applicable to jobs with elements of persuasion, which describe many types of jobs and industries such as law, marketing, non-profit fundraising, as well as many managerial positions,” he said.\\nThe study suggests that having even just one human evaluator early in the hiring process can help optimize costs and increase accuracy.\\n“Given the need to reduce costs, I do see this being valuable in industry,” Dover said.\\nChiong said the team has received inquiries from companies, which would indicate interest in adopting the study’s framework.\\n“Our study also echoes prevailing sentiments in the AI space that AI does not fully replace humans, but knowing how to augment AI with human collaboration will be important,” he said.\\nDover said the team’s research stands out because it was an ambitious project that took several years to complete with several data collection cycles.\\n“We had the unique ability to recapture data for this project,” he said.\\xa0“I think the unique use of AI and video models are key to why this paper was recognized.”\\nChiong said B2B sales is an important but understudied area of research, as there are many challenges such as the lack of institutional knowledge and data about companies’ internal sales operations.\\n“This paper is being recognized for this unique contribution to the field,” he said. “The collaboration between UTD, Yale and Wisconsin has also uniquely positioned us to advance more studies in this area in the coming years. I think you will see a lot more research publications using Center for Professional Sales data. Also, we will be launching several other initiatives for the Sales and Sales Technology community.”\\nCenter for Professional SalesMarketingSales\\nView all posts by Jimmie Markham\\nMore from Faculty/Research - News Category\\nProfessor Milind Dawande Remembered at Jindal School Event\\nJindal School Ranks No. 6 Worldwide in FT Research Productivity Rankings\\n2025 UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings™\\nAdvancing Marketing Science: Key Discussions from the Jindal School’s 2025 Bass FORMS Conference\\nResearcher Honors His Father Though His Healthcare Work\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

The chapter’s mission, she says, is to educate, support and enhance the performance of its members and marketing professionals in the metroplex.\\n“The special interest groups are academic and industry communities within the American Marketing Association created to advance scholarly knowledge and enhance marketing practices,” she said. “As the EVP of SIGs, my responsibility is twofold. First, it is to explore industry trends and opportunities which may be of interest to marketers in DFW. Second, it is to provide a solutions-driven forum for DFW professionals to meet and share ideas, expand skills and experiences and boost the local marketing community.”\\nAmong her goals for this role are to position the chapter as a leading source of marketing trends and opportunities for local professionals and advance the knowledge and skills of the DFW marketing community. The latter is achieved, she said, through panels, workshops and other events throughout the year, along with growing the chapter.\\nFrom an academic perspective, Albrecht has been involved with the American Marketing Association by serving as a\\xa0faculty\\xa0judge\\xa0for the annual collegiate competitions (Cases, College Chapter Website and Annual Report) since 2021. She not only started the American Marketing Association student chapter at Texas Woman’s University but is currently collaborating with the student chapter at UT Dallas to host a presentation in mid-February. Entitled “Building the Foundations for Your First Job,” it is being presented to help the university’s business students fulfill their career aspirations, she says.\\nAlbrecht is also excited for 2025 SIG events, the first one scheduled for March 25. With artificial intelligence a hot topic, it will lead off the year with: “From Basics to Application: How to AI Your 2025.” Tentatively, events are scheduled every quarter this year.\\nAlbrecht has long been a proponent of the American Marketing Association. Her membership enabled her to take a course from the Digital Marketing Institute which allowed her to graduate as a Certified Digital Marketer Professional. She relishes chances to give back, including being a 2025 mentor providing coaching to a protégé.\\n“I have been a member for many years because it has been a great opportunity to grow my marketing network, stay on top of the latest marketing technology, share ideas and insights with peers and serve the marketing community,” she said.\\nHer involvement in the American Marketing Association has already paid dividends for her students, such as sharing with them the latest concepts and frameworks from her Digital Marketing certification for theSocial Impact Marketing(MKT 4360) course she teaches, and she looks forward to how her new DFW chapter position will present strong opportunities for them.\\n“My role as EVP of SIGs requires exposure to industry possibilities and awareness of marketers’ interests to advance the profession as well as the careers of our members,” said Albrecht, who is also vice president of marketing for Alonos. “As a professor, I am able to share these opportunities and knowledge with my students to help them advance in their future careers.”\\nBS MarketingMarketingMarketing Career FocusMS Marketing\\nView all posts by Eric Butterman\\nMore from Faculty/Research - News Category\\nProfessor Milind Dawande Remembered at Jindal School Event\\nJindal School Ranks No. 6 Worldwide in FT Research Productivity Rankings']},\n",

It was the fifth victory for JSOM in the annual event.\\nThe winning team’s members earned a $3,000 cash award, along with individual trophies and one-year memberships in ACHE.\\nAll five members of the first-place team areMBAstudents, and four of the five are dual-degree seekers. Fares Stanbouly is an MBA student. Avani Alla and Dheera Dammanna are also pursuingMS degrees in Business Analytics; and Adam Jurecki and Allison Potter are also pursuingMS degrees in Healthcare Leadership and Management.\\nThe Jindal School entered two teams in the competition for the first time this year. The winners placed ahead of their fellow UT Dallas competitors and teams from the University of North Texas Health Science Center, Texas State University and the UTHealth School of Public Health.\\nThis year, participants offered solutions to an “anchor mission” project for UMass Memorial Health Care. The Democracy Collaborative, a community-development think tank in Washington, D.C., created the idea of an anchor mission, an effort to link the economic power and other resources of institutions such as colleges and hospitals to the communities in which they reside in order to help ensure the ongoing well-being of those communities.\\n“I think we came in first place because we had a wide variety of solutions rather than one big one,” team member Fares Stanbouly said. “There were many issues to address, and I thought that our solutions covered most of them.”\\nJSOM Student Wins Marketer of the Year Award for Impactful Class Project\\nNaveen Jindal School of Management junior Shannon Cotts was named 2019 Collegiate Marketer of the Year by theDallas-Fort Worth chapterof the American Marketing Association. The award was among 26 presented at the organization’s annual awards gala last May.\\nAn accounting and marketing double major, Cotts won for work she had done in a Marketing Projects (MKT 4370) class with teammates Matthew Barker, Alyssa Martindale and Colby Thompson. The students developed a marketing plan to help increase consumer awareness of Fixd, a Dallas-based home warranty and service repair company. The project required extensive consumer research. The firm indicated the students’ work played a part in the company’s acquisition in January 2019 by ANGI Homeservices, the parent company of Angie’s List, a web-based home services company.\\nAt the beginning of the project, the students met with Fixd leadership and discovered that the startup company had not conducted much market research in the past. Going in, the students hypothesized that Fixd would gain momentum by first interacting with consumers through its one-off repair services and then be able to upsell its home warranty products after gaining their trust.\\n“That was not the case,” Cotts said. “We determined that people were actually attracted to Fixd based on home warranty, not on home service. We found out that most people already have someone they already trust to do their quick repairs. To tear them away from those relationships would take a lot of energy.”\\nAccounting Alum Earns Top CPA Exam Recognition\\nMatthew Brooks did not follow a traditional path to his current job as a tax consultant for Deloitte in Dallas. After changing his major a few times, Brooks completed his undergraduate degree in French studies at Brigham Young University, then worked for several years as a banker before coming to theNaveen Jindal School of Managementto pursue anMS in Accountingdegree.\\nUnconventional as it may be, Brooks credits this combination of career exploration and prior work experience — along with his JSOM professors — for his success in his graduate program and on thecertified public accountant exam, where he passed all four sections on his first try with a high score that earned him a prestigious award from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\\n“I was not as focused as an undergraduate, but after a few years working and going back to school, I had a greater understanding for what you learn in classes and how it helps in the real world,” said Brooks, who graduated in August 2018. “I began to not just study to pass a test, but to truly grasp concepts and ideas, which further helped me when it came time to take the CPA Exam.”\\nBrooks was awarded a 2018Elijah Watt Sells Awardin recognition of obtaining a cumulative average score of 95.50 across all four sections of the exam on his first attempt. Each section is scored on a scale of 0 to 99, and only 110 of the 86,000 who sat for the CPA Exam in 2018 met the criteria for the award. The recipients were announced in April.\\nMore from Jindal School Now\\nJindal SchoolNow- January 2025\\nThe University of Texas at Dallas held a groundbreaking ceremony Oct. 8 for a new addition to the Naveen Jindal School of Management’s complex.

              "  'chunks': ['Jindal Students Plug Into AT&T’s Smart-Cities Project\\nAlumni Spotlights\\nTestimonials\\nNewsletters\\nG.O.A.T. Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- March 7th, 2017 -Academics,Corporate\\nGraduate students who recently took an entrepreneurship course at theNaveen Jindal School of Managementwalked away from the experience knowing that they had made a significant real-world contribution.\\nThe class,The Entrepreneurial Experience (ENTP 6398), gave students an opportunity to engage withAT&T Smart Cities. Taught byDr. Rajiv Shah, an innovation and entrepreneurship professor and director of theMS in Systems Engineering and Managementprogram, the students shared their ideas on how AT&T, using its Smart Cities framework and internet of things innovation, should expand its products and solutions into new cities.\\nSmart Cities is a framework of interconnected technologies that use wireless networks, and telecommunications networks in general, to help connect communities with city infrastructures. Smart Cities’ solutions target problems associated with dense urban and suburban areas —congestion, limited parking, energy-intensive streetlights — as well as safety and security issues and larger infrastructure issues such as power outages, wear and tear of bridges and roads and water leaks. A Smart Cities app, for instance, might automate notification of the need for garbage collection or that a streetlight has stopped functioning properly. Or it could tell a driver that a parking spot has become available or that a streetlight has stopped functioning properly. Cities can detect and monitor outages and notify citizens in near-real time.\\nAs part of the course, the students focused on helping AT&T Smart Cities identify and develop potential business opportunities and document data within five key vertical markets: energy and utilities, transportation, citizen engagement, public safety and infrastructure.\\n“Smart Cities is about connectivity and collaboration,” said Mike Zeto, general manager and executive director, AT&T Smart Cities. “The Jindal School is known for fostering innovation, so it only made sense to collaborate with the school to identify solutions that would help us address challenges in these key verticals.”\\nStudents in the class split into five groups, each in charge of a region within the U.S.: Northeast, South Atlantic, North Central, South Central and West. The students were tasked first with identifying companies that provide connected solutions to cities from their assigned regions, as well as the value chains and value propositions those companies could offer.\\nNext, each team researched and identified target cities for its respective region. Students researched global cities that already have employed smart-city solutions from the five targeted verticals so that they could determine what city within their region would most benefit from similar smart-city solutions from AT&T.\\nFrom there, each team formulated a go-to-market strategy for its target city. All teams proposed partner companies that could implement the solutions for AT&T, what solutions those companies could offer, potential business models, revenue opportunities, cost savings, environmental sustainability impact available from implementing those solutions, market size, potential level of interest, pricing, promotion and rollout plans, capital and investment required — basically all the elements of a corporate internal startup launch.\\nEmployees from AT&T Smart Cities and Internet of Things business units were available to the student teams as domain experts and consultants. Students benefited from being in close proximity to the City of Dallas, which is rolling out its own Smart Cities effort in collaboration with AT&T — one being spearheaded by Jennifer Sanders, executive director of theDallas Innovation Alliance. Not only were the students able to witness a real-life Smart City while working on the project, but the school’s relationship with the group offers an opportunity for further engagement between UT Dallas and City of Dallas efforts in Smart Cities.\\n“The methodology is there,” Shah said. “There’s a lot of research and analysis that’s gone into this project. Mike Zeto and the other AT&T Smart Cities project members we worked with will already have a solid case to take to their managers to explain why they should roll it out in each one of those cities.”\\nThe cities selected by the five teams were Providence, R.I.; Columbus, Ohio; San Jose, Calif.; Austin, Texas; and Orlando, Fla. Although there was no guarantee that AT&T would immediately pursue those cities, the company nonetheless benefited from the students’ findings.\\n“The solutions proposed by the students in Rajiv’s class reveal high levels of creativity, intelligence and academic rigor,” Zeto said. “Those traits are all needed to help us drive value to our customers as we continue to provide world-class solutions for cities.”\\nMS Systems Engineering and Management\\nView all posts by Jimmie Markham\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Podcast\\nbyGlenda Vosburgh- October 8th, 2024 -Events,Faculty/Research\\nTop researchers from around the United States and internationally gathered at theNaveen Jindal School of Managementrecently for the2024 UT Dallas Fall Finance Conference.\\nIn its seventh year, the conference, organized by JSOM’sFinance and Managerial Economics Area, hosted 75 scholars on Sept. 27 and 28.\\nResearchers worldwide were invited to submit papers to be considered for the conference. A program committee comprised of Jindal School finance faculty led by Drs. Jun Li and Han Xia, who selected ten out of 220 submissions to be presented at the conference.\\nEach presentation was allotted 20 minutes, followed by a 15-minute discussion of the research by a discussant. Questions, further discussion, and exchange of ideas followed.\\nDiscussants used their expertise to provide commentary on the papers and explore how each one advances the topic. They are a vital component of the conference, according toDr. Harold Zhang, a finance professor and area coordinator in the Jindal School’s Finance and Managerial Economics Area.\\n“We chose leading scholars for discussants of each paper who are experts in those areas,” he said. “That is a benefit to the researchers and the attendees. I believe that is one of the reasons for the success of this conference.”\\nDr. Hasan Pirkul, Caruth Chair and Jindal School dean, welcomed attendees and shared information about the school.\\n“One of the things that make me most proud is our research ranking,” he said. “It is used by staff, PhD students, and others.”\\nResearch is a foundational element of the Jindal School and plays a crucial role in the academic experience. It enables students to explore cutting-edge topics and have an impact in their fields of study.\\nThe UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings™were created by JSOM to track publications in 24 leading peer-reviewed academic journals that focus on business. It contains titles and author affiliations of papers published in those journals since 1990. The information is used to provide the top 100 business school rankings since 1990 based on the total contributions of faculty.\\nFaculty members from JSOM’s Finance and Managerial Area chaired each session, includingDr. Hao Pang, an assistant professor.\\n“The conference was incredibly beneficial to me in several ways,” he said. “It provided a unique opportunity to meet and connect with scholars from various fields, allowing me to gain insights beyond my own area of research.\\n“This was especially valuable for me as a junior researcher who hasn’t yet had the chance to connect with many people in the finance field. Engaging with experts on different topics opened up new perspectives and introduced me to frontier research ideas in finance that I wouldn’t normally encounter in my regular readings. These discussions not only expanded my knowledge but also sparked new ideas for potential interdisciplinary collaborations.”\\nKeynote speaker Itay Goldstein, a professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, addressed financial fragility and responses to crises and differences in ESG (environmental, social and governance) investors and traditional investors in “Amplification and Fragility in Financial Markets.”']},\n",

              "  'chunks': ['Faculty Research\\nCareers\\nDoctoral Student’s Research Uncovers Peers’ Efforts to Stymie Career Advancements\\nDoctoral student Carliss Miller’s research borrows from old fishing wisdom: You don’t need to put a lid on a bucket of crabs to keep them from escaping. They will pull each other back down as they attempt to crawl to freedom. Her research takes on real-life issues minorities face in climbing the career ladder — and “out of the pot.”\\nMiller’s research finds that, counterintuitively, minorities can be each other’s worst enemies in the struggle to get ahead. The research earned first place for the Delores P. Aldridge Graduate Student Research Award at the recent Association of Social and Behavioral Scientists annual conference.\\nMiller, who is midway through her PhD studies at The University of Texas at Dallas Naveen Jindal School of Management, has used a newly developed tool for uncovering such biases, called “netnography.” She culls Internet blogs and posts to find narrative data — people “venting how they feel.” She has found that diversity reigns online, and she has uncovered a very diverse sampling for her studies.\\nOne issue Miller faces is how “minority” is defined. Another is the perception that resources, whatever they may be — a better job, bigger office, higher pay, better educational opportunities — have limited availability to those in the minority. The result is what Filipino fishermen call “crabs in a pot” syndrome — no crab wants any crab to succeed in escaping. As a crab starts clawing its way to freedom over the open top, other crabs below pull it back down into the bucket, ensuring no crab is successful.\\nSimilarly, those in the minority see limited resources or opportunities. In some cases, they do not want to help another within their group achieve a goal, fearing it could lead to their own diminishment. It is “if I can’t have it, neither can you” behavior.\\nWhile Miller’s research is still unpublished, it is getting media and scholarly attention.\\nJindal School’sDr. David L. Ford Jr., Miller’s mentor for this research and the one who suggested she submit her findings to ASBS, said Miller’s research “is breaking new ground in the study of workplace incivility since it examines a key violation of workplace norms.”\\n“In other words,” Ford said, “there’s an expectation of collaboration and in-group solidarity among persons belonging to an organizationally marginalized group.”\\nFord said Miller is about a year away from submitting her research for publication. She is presenting her research again in August at theAcademy of Management’s annual meeting, which is convening in Vancouver.\\nMiller, a doctoral student ininternational management studieswho is interested in culture, diversity and workplace incivility, earned an MBA from the University of Florida. She was recruited to UT Dallas by Ford.\\n“Her research has the potential to shed light on what is perhaps a ‘taboo’ or non-discussable issue in organizational life,” Ford said.\\nMore from Rotator\\nAmerican Heart Association to Honor Associate Dean for Community Impact\\nAccounting Students Score Scholarships from the Texas Society of CPAs\\nBig Idea Competition Finals Will Put Kawasaki’s Art of Innovation on Display\\nThe iPhone X:  Will it pop or will it fizzle?\\nJindal School Alumna Earns Women in Technology Award\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Podcast\\nbyJill Glass- August 2nd, 2016 -Academics\\nThe Naveen Jindal School of Management is launching a newbusiness economics concentrationto answer the growing demand for graduates with analytical and applied business skills in a variety of business fields including finance, banking, planning and management.\\nThe school’s newest concentration within theBachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA)degree program, the business economics concentration will be available in fall 2016. The concentration is designed for students who enjoy analyzing how systems work and is excellent preparation for students planning to go to graduate school, according toDr. Peter Lewin, finance and managerial economics professor and director of the business economics concentration.\\n“To be a knowledgeable actor in the business world and in the world in general, a basic understanding of economics is crucial,” Lewin said. “But an economics background is also a wonderful grounding for law school as well as students going on to get their MBA and other degrees—even engineering. In terms of the business subjects such as finance and accounting, economics is way up there, if not right at the top.”\\nLewin and three other professors in the Jindal School’sFinance and Managerial Economics Areabegan exploring career prospects and the academic performances of students’ postgraduate studies and learned that not only do students with an economic preparation perform better in graduate school, they also earn bigger paychecks, Lewin said.\\nThe Wall Street Journal recently published datafrom a study conducted by PayScale, Inc., an online salary, benefits and compensation information company, indicating that economics graduates’ salaries outpace salaries from all other disciplines, with the exception of engineering, and are even higher as the graduates advance in their careers. The research shows that economics majors earn a median salary of $50,100 as they enter the job market, compared to $49,200 for management information systems majors, $47,900 for finance majors and $46,000 for accounting majors. Economics majors’ median mid-career salary jumps to $98,600 while management information systems, finance and accounting median mid-career salaries move to $82,300, $88,300 and $77,100, respectively, according to the study.\\nAll Jindal School undergraduates in all degree programs are required to take introductory micro- and macroeconomics, but a business economics concentration requires additional coursework in micro- and macroeconomics.\\nTo pursue a concentration in business economics, students must take 15 credit hours in the following core courses: ECON 3310 (Intermediate Microeconomic Theory), ECON 3311 (Intermediate Macroeconomic Theory), MECO 4342 (Financial and Business Negotiation Analysis), MECO 4351 (Industrial Organization and Corporate Strategy) and MECO 4352 (Applied Econometrics and Time Series Analysis). In addition, business economics students must select nine semester credit hours in any upper division business courses.\\n“Businesses these days are looking for students who not only have technical proficiency in the various disciplines like operations research, finance, behavioral management and marketing, but also are able to engage in critical thinking and independent and bold decision making, and economics provides those critical thinking skills and also a framework for conceptual decision-making,” Lewin said.\\nBS Business AdministrationBS Finance\\nView all posts by Jill Glass\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

              "  'chunks': ['Students will have several options for accumulating service hours. They can volunteer at approved nonprofit organizations, they can enroll in courses that have a service component, or they can do a combination of the two.\\nQualifying course projects might involve creating a marketing plan for a nonprofit, helping an organization with financial statements or undertaking other assignments to help a charitable or service agency.\\nThe new initiative is a result of discussions that Dr. Hasan Pirkul, Caruth Chair and Jindal School dean, has had with Kaplan in recent years about how best to fulfill some the school’s core mission objectives, namely, how to deliver the highest quality management education within the context of 21st century society’s complex realities.\\nFrom those meetings, they had first launched an internship requirement in 2014.\\n“One reason we had set up the internship requirement was that students had a tendency to wait too long to apply or talked themselves out of it,” Kaplan said. “We’re now getting them to try different companies and slightly different positions to really figure out what they want to do in their career long before they’ve graduated. It has gone so well that we decided to add a layer of community service to their education.”\\nAlthough 100 hours of community service may seem daunting at first glance, over four years that breaks down to 25 hours a year or 12½ hours a semester.\\n“Students could knock that outwhile studying abroad, over a single weekend, during alternative spring break, or even by volunteering an hour or two at a time at various points during the course of a semester,” Kaplan said. “If students did just two hours of volunteer work every week, they would fulfill their obligation in less than a year.”100 Hours in One SemesterRobert WrightRobert Wright, a senior lecturer in innovation and entrepreneurship, is teaching a social entrepreneurship course,Social Sector Engagement and Community Outreach (ENTP 4340), that will fulfill all 100 required hours in a single semester. Transfer students might prefer this option if they are trying to keep to a four-year graduation timeline.“The students will apply skills developed through their academic studies to real-world issues encountered by small, developing businesses,” Wright said. “Think of these projects as consulting assignments and the businesses as clients. Teams will deliver targeted solutions to identified problems designed to allow success in the context of a single semester.”Wright, who sits on the board of directors atUnited Way of Metropolitan Dallas, worked with the organization throughout last summer to design an application that can log and track the service component of the course.“This requirement has the potential to either enrich the lives of Jindal School students by giving them a community expression, or it changes the course of their lives by sending them down a path of working in community service,” Wright said.Volunteering at the Comet Closet, a JSOM-based program that provides students professional attire for internship and job interviews, students can learn and practice such “soft” interpersonal skills as listening, communicating and empathizing with others.The requirement also provides students with opportunities to reinforce soft skills they learn at the Jindal School.“Community service is a form of leadership training,” Pirkul said. “Students learn how to communicate a clear vision of the organization they serve, analyze issues, solve problems, delegate tasks, build trust, and influence and motivate others to contribute to the cause. These are valuable skills that any employer would expect when they look to hire someone.”Service OpportunitiesThe Jindal School has collaborated with bothUnited Way of Metropolitan Dallasand theUT Dallas Office of Student Volunteerismto connect students with a wide range of service opportunities. Students will be able to sign up for volunteer work that suits their interests and skills, and will log completed service hours using project management software.Administrators have taken into account the fact that many JSOM students already perform community service through fraternities, sororities or student organizations. Those students will be able to count service hours with organizations that have been approved as partners.“Many students were already doing the entire 100 hours or more,” said Dr. Marilyn Kaplan, associate dean of undergraduate programs. “We were just never able to collect the data or know the impact of what our student body was doing until now.”Dr. Julie Haworth (kneeling, far right) celebrated the successful efforts of students in her fall 2015 Product and Brand Management course to help nonprofits in advance of North Texas Giving Day.Other course offerings for fall 2018 that can fulfill part of the new service requirement include the following:Business Basics (BA1100), a required core course for all incoming freshmen, will have a community service component that satisfies five hours of a student’s obligation.Product and Brand Management (MKT 3320)offers students a chance to earn 20 service hours working with a nonprofit on a project in advance ofNorth Texas Giving Day.Digital and Internet Marketing (MKT 4330)may fulfill 10 hours as students develop Google Adwords campaigns for small businesses if the campaign is for a nonprofit.Marketing Research (MKT 3340)may satisfy 20 hours of the community service obligation as students conduct a survey and analyze the results for a nonprofit community partner.Dr. Daniel Rajaratnam, a clinical professor in marketing, teaches the marketing research course. His students can earn hours by helping nonprofit businesses and organizations such asHabitat for Humanity ReStoresand theHumane Society. Rajaratnam said that service projects have multiple benefits — the students get practical experience, the business and organizations get much needed help and the University gets to give back to the community.View all posts by Jimmie Markham\\n100 Hours in One Semester\\nRobert Wright, a senior lecturer in innovation and entrepreneurship, is teaching a social entrepreneurship course,Social Sector Engagement and Community Outreach (ENTP 4340), that will fulfill all 100 required hours in a single semester.

              "  'chunks': ['Another great way to meet people is by going toevents on campus. There is always something or other going on. This semester, I got to see Donna Meagle from the popular comedy TV show Parks and Recreation do stand up.\\nI also got to meet my favorite Viner andYou Tuber Jus Reign. If you don’t know who he is, you should definitely go check out his Vine channel, he’s HILARIOUS!\\nAnother piece of advice to surviving freshman year would be to not give in to the freshman 15 (or more like freshman 35)!\\nIt is a VERY real thing. Your first semester in college can be very scary, especially when finals roll around. Stress eating is a huge contributor to the freshman 15. The best way to avoid this is by starting to prepare for finals a couple weeks in advance. UTD’sStudent Success Centeroffers Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) and Supplemental Instruction (SI) for most of the classes offered.\\nYou can also form a separate study group with friends from your classes if that works better for you. TheMcDermott Libraryis open 24 hours five days a week, which is definitely an added bonus. During finals week, you will see students taking their blankets and pillows to the library in preparation to pulling all-nighters.\\nOne of the hardest challenges college students face is actually graduating in four years. Most public colleges have a whopping19 percent of students who earn their bachelor’s degree in four years. This can be very scary, because time is money and students want to graduate from college debt-free.\\nHowever, you shouldn’t let the fear of graduating late force you to take more credit hours then you can handle, especially freshman year. At the end of the day, your GPA is a lot more important than how fast you finish school. You should also make sure you take classes that make sense for your major. For example business majors need to take 6 credit hours of science. If biology or chemistry isn’t your thing, don’t take them; you can always take something easier like an online Earthquakes and Volcanoes class.\\nFinally, don’t forget to have fun and go a little crazy! College is all about trying things you never normally would, so put yourself out of your comfort zone every once in a while. ☺\\nYou’ll never get these years back, so you should make the most of it!\\nStudent ExperienceStudent Organizations\\nView all posts by Disha Patil\\nMore from College Knowledge - Blog Category\\nStudent Spotlight: Anthony Chu\\nAnthony Chu is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and he is expected to graduate Dec. 2026.\\nStudent Spotlight: Dena Aljabari\\nDena Aljabari is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and Analytics and she is expected to graduate May 2025.\\nStudent Spotlight: Nnamdi Edeoga\\nNnamdi Edeoga is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management and is expected to graduate in May 2025.\\n5 Reasons to Study Risk Management and Cyber Security at UT Dallas\\nAn understanding of risk management and cybersecurity can help individuals create resilient businesses that can stand the test of potential threats.\\nStudent Spotlight: Madison Hill\\nMadison Hill is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management and a Bachelor of Science in Finance double-major and she is expected to graduate May 2026.\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Podcast\\nbyJoy Donovan- February 22nd, 2024 -Alumni,Events\\nThis letter from R. Chandrasekaran altered the course of Dipak Jain’s lifeA dog-eared letter dated April 7, 1982, is so important toDr. Dipak C. Jain, PhD’86, MS’86, that he has kept it for forty-plus years.\\nThe letter is so special to him that he began his recent presentation to PhD students at theNaveen Jindal School of Managementby flashing a photo of it for them to see. The one-paragraph letter invited him to further his education atThe University of Texas at Dallasand was signed by “R. Chandrasekaran,” who at the time was a professor of operations research in the School of Management. Dr. Chandrasekaran is now Ashbel Smith Professor in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science.\\n“That man made me what I am today,” Jain told students and faculty during his recent visit to the Jindal School. It was at UT Dallas that he earned an MS and PhD in management science in 1986. “A small letter like this brought me here. I consider this a place of opportunity.”\\nJain, a soft-spoken man with an easy smile, accepted that invitation and went on to excel in his chosen career. The esteemed educator visited his alma mater’s campus to accept the Jindal School’s inaugural Eminent PhD Alumnus Award.\\nHe fell into his career in management education almost by accident. As a student, he discovered through tutoring sessions with his own peers just how much he loved teaching.\\n“To me, this room is a temple,” Jain said to UT Dallas’ current PhD students assembled in a Jindal School lecture hall. “UT Dallas is no less than any school in the country, when it comes to the PhD program.”\\nJain, who calls himself “the hugging dean,” exudes warmth and a gentle manner. His respect for the students, his previous supervisors and his own educational path was evident during his daylong visit on campus. His multiple presentations focused on business management, but much of his personal philosophy woven into those lectures made an impact on those attending.\\n“He gave some really nice examples of how you treat people,” saidPaul Nichols, MBA’98, an associate professor of practice in the Jindal School’sOrganizations, Strategy and International Management Area. “He kept making the point of how a little bit of kindness transformed his life. That opened an entire world for him. That’s the magic of being in the academic world. It’s not just testing and assignments.”\\nJain’s two lectures underscored this notion. During his talks, Jain sprinkled inspirational concepts for his upper-level students to consider. Among them, a simple but impactful thought, “Wherever you travel, introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you. Be proactive.”\\nHe also narrated stories that revealed another philosophy, saying that “I think about my journey from success to significance. While you’re successful, think about how you can make a difference in the peoples’ lives who work with you and for you.”\\nChoosing Jain as the first-ever recipient of the honor was easy, according toDr. Sumit Sarkar, JSOM’s director of PhD programs and the Charles and Nancy Davidson Chair and a professor in the Jindal School’sInformation Systems Area. The idea was originally floated by Dean Hasan Pirkul. The decision was made by the PhD Committee, and its members were unanimous in their decision that Jain was the right alum to be the first to receive this honor.\\n“Of course it was a no brainer,” Sarkar said. “We are extremely proud of him. He is fantastic.”\\nThe honoree was invited to speak and was also entertained at receptions in celebration of his achievements. Eventually, Jain will be honored in a “PhD Hall of Fame” that will be created in the School of Management building, saidDr. Hasan Pirkul, Caruth Chair and Jindal School.\\n“It is really great to see him come back because he is an ideal role model for young PhDs,” Pirkul said after presenting Jain with the award at an afternoon reception attended by faculty, students and other stakeholders. “He has not only been very successful in research, but he has also been a well-known and highly respected leader in terms of managing schools. But more importantly he’s a genuinely nice guy. Everyone likes him. If the PhDs only remember that, that would be the best contribution to their lives.”']},\n",

Inducted as a Charter Fellow of SIAM in 2009, Bensoussan is a leading expert in stochastic control and risk management. He presently is focused on an emerging field of research that studies individual decision-making within large populations.\\nThe SIAM award selection committee said it wished to recognize Dr. Bensoussan for his “fundamental contributions in partial differential equations, deterministic as well as stochastic, including applications in filtering, stochastic and impulsive control, optimal stopping, variational inequalities and mean field game theory.”\\nBesides $10,000 and an engraved medal, the annual prize carries a request that the honoree deliver a lecture at the annual meeting.\\nIn 2013, Bensoussan was awarded a $339,570, three-year grant from the National Science Foundation to study mean field game theory. The research seeks to explain, model and ultimately make predictions about behavior.\\nThe term ‘mean field” refers to a physics concept that attempts to describe the effect of an infinite number of particles on the motion of a single particle. Researchers began to apply the concept to social sciences in the last decade to study how an infinite number of factors affect individual decisions.\\nMean field game theory has the potential for many applications, Bensoussan says, from predicting traffic outcomes in order to prevent accidents to gauging the impact of new technology.\\nThe theory also may help explain economic phenomena, Bensoussan says. The long-accepted equilibrium theory holds that the market forces of supply and demand bring an economy to a point of equilibrium. But Bensoussan says that equilibrium theory fails to explain the recent economic crisis. “We need new theory. If mean field can provide something in that direction, it would be useful.”\\nHis NSF project is recapped in a mathematics brief, Mean Field Games and Mean Field Type Control Theory (New York: SpringerBriefs; 2013) , written with co-authors Jens Frehse of the University of Bonn and Philip Yam of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\\nMore from Rotator\\nAmerican Heart Association to Honor Associate Dean for Community Impact\\nAccounting Students Score Scholarships from the Texas Society of CPAs\\nBig Idea Competition Finals Will Put Kawasaki’s Art of Innovation on Display\\nThe iPhone X:  Will it pop or will it fizzle?\\nJindal School Alumna Earns Women in Technology Award\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

              "  'chunks': ['Q) Some style tips for the JSOM ladies out there?\\nScarves…they always make something plain look extraordinary. During winter, you can spot me wearing a different color scarf every day.\\nQ) Any crazy memorable experience in a foreign land that stands out?\\nI have taken students on over 40 international trips during my career. I have traveled to China, Hong Kong, Japan, England, Belgium, France, Spain and more.\\nOne of the most memorable moments was landing in Japan a month after the nuclear disaster that resulted from the 2011 earthquake. I was waiting for a flight to Hong Kong with the students, when a 6.8 aftershock hit the terminal. The floor rolled in waves, and some students were knocked to the floor. The students were pleading with me to get the airline to take off sooner. The turmoil did not end there. Another aftershock hit as the plane rolled down the runway.\\nQ) Pop Quiz — Name the following:\\nOne Taylor Swift song? – Shake it off something?\\nYour favorite song? – Phillip Phillips’ “Home”\\nYour favorite place in JSOM? – The window sill next to Jason’s Deli, watching all the students walk by.\\nThe happiest place on earth? – It is not a place to me, but it is the time when I have my husband, children, grandchildren around me. Not when they are paying any attention to me, but tiny things like my daughter arguing an impressive position on an important issue, my son trying to fix something, my grandchildren running around. When they are near me, and I am watching them live their lives, just knowing that I had the privilege of being in their lives.\\nQ) What is your favorite American tradition, and what is the one thing that you would urge all the international students to experience in U.S.?\\nExperience an American Thanksgiving. It is my absolute favorite holiday. It is all about being thankful for all our blessings and for this great country in which we live. When I was a kid and lived outside of the U.S., my military father would round up any miscellaneous Americans he could find and invite them to our house. We would all be required to tell each other what we were most thankful for. I remember one year, living in Iran, one member at the table said they were really thankful for American-style toilets. It was priceless.\\nQ) Everyone agrees that you have a great sense of humor. Tell us a joke that cracks you up every single time you hear it.\\nWhen my son was in his second grade, his school had a joke day. He could not find a joke, and suddenly he came home, and told me the following:\\nQ: Where do sheep go for vacation?\\nA: To the baaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhamas.\\nIt became my all-time favorite joke the next instant.\\nQ) Name five things or words that make Monica Powell happy.\\nTime with my husband of 34 years.\\nTime with my grown kids and grandkids.\\nChocolate.\\nTime with Lisa Shatz, Tom Kim and Shawn Alborz, my three dear, dear friends.\\nBanana splits – I love, love, love them!\\nQ) Name five things Monica Powell needs to have in her office bag.\\nI keep so much in my purse that it is often referred to as luggage. If you are looking for something while at school and can’t find it, then come look in my purse. You name it; I have it.\\nQ) You have recently taken to Twitter and Instagram. How do you like them, and what is your advice to the baby boomers out there who detest social media?\\nJust practice. It is tough, I agree, but keep practicing, and you will get the hang of it.\\nProfessor Monica’s awesomeness does not quite end here. More awe-inspiring moments await, as we return next week with our second and final installment of this interview with JSOM’s amazing Associate Dean, Monica Powell.\\nInspirationInterviewsPersonal ImprovementPhD\\nView all posts by Devi Priya Karuppiah']},\n",

Anyone who wants to serve as a YSP mentor must complete the online YSP mentor questionnaire, at the invitation of the YSP program director, and then interview with the director. Those chosen to be YSP mentors must also complete a Dallas ISD volunteer application (which includes a criminal background screen) and attend a brief training session led by the YSP director.\\nShowing up for students is crucial to the mentoring program success.

The YSP mentoring program will be conducted primarily via an online platform to allow the flexibility needed to communicate effectively and in a timely manner.\\nJYSP Financial Support FAQ\\nThe YSP advisory board, comprised of committed professionals who understand the needs and relevance of the Young Scholars Program, welcomes other members who are passionate about educating all of Dallas’ students to their highest ability level.

Podcast\\nbyT.D. Christensen- October 26th, 2017 -Events,Students\\nUT Dallas Camp Kesem Chapter Aims to Raise $40K\\nWhenNaveen Jindal School of Managementaccounting majors David Gutierrez and Ryan Townsend decided to launch a nonprofit organization last year, they knew it would take lots of time, hard work and sweat.\\n“It’s a crazy emotional journey,” says Gutierrez, co-director of the campus chapter of Camp Kesem, which provides a free weeklong summer camp for the children of parents who have battled cancer.“It’s so heartbreaking hearing the kids talk about what they’re going through. You just want to cry in front of them, but you try to put your emotions aside and have a big cry after they leave.”Founded in 2001, Camp Kesem — the word kesem means magic in Hebrew — is the largest national organization dedicated to supporting children through and beyond their parent’s cancer. College student leaders run each of the 105 chapters around the U.S. In early 2016, Gutierrez and Townsend signed up to start a new chapter at UT Dallas and recruited a dozen fellow students to help them.“I fell in the love with the cause,” says Townsend, the other co-director of the UT Dallas chapter. “Kesem’s mission of serving kids affected by a parent’s cancer really hit home for me … multiple members of my family have been affected by cancer, including my mom, aunt and grandmother.”Gutierrez felt close to the mission, as well. While cancer has not affected his immediate family, one of his siblings has hydrocephalus, a chronic brain condition that has required multiple hospital stays.“As soon as I heard about this opportunity, I knew this was the one for me,” Gutierrez says. “When I was awardeda full scholarship from the Terry Foundation, it set a fire inside of me. I knew I wanted to help people and empower kids who are part of this forgotten demographic.”Gutierrez, Townsend and their fellow Kesem teammates raised more than $29,000 to send 27 children ages 6 to 16 to a weeklong retreat last summer at Camp Gilmont in the East Texas town of Gilmer. Like most summer camps, Camp Kesem offers a wide range of fun indoor and outdoor activities, from archery to dance classes to s’mores-making.“It’s a chance for kids to get away from it all,” Gutierrez says.But campers are also encouraged to talk about what they are going through back home. Two licensed therapists are on hand all times, and everyone circles up for a midweek “empowerment ceremony” to share stories of their parent’s cancer.“There wasn’t a dry eye in the room,” says Townsend. “Each kid, despite having been through so much, was brave enough to not only share their story but to offer support to their fellow campers while they were struggling with their own emotions.”For many kids, Camp Kesem offers a sense of kinship and optimism — two things that are often hard to find during difficult times.“I feel more upbeat now … I met so many friends, and I came home from Camp Kesem feeling brighter than ever,” says an 11-year-old girl who goes by “Wolf Spirit.” (Campers and staff members use “camp names” to protect anonymity.)“Kesem was the highlight of my summer … it was one of the best things that ever happened to me,” she says.Gutierrez and Townsend hope to expand the camp next summer to include 40 kids. To do that, they need to raise $40,000 from individual and corporate donations, including a gala fundraising event to be held in April 2018.“David and Ryan have a real burning desire to give back,” saysJohn Barden, assistant dean, Executive Education. Barden gave the two students guidance in launching Camp Kesem while they were taking his managerial accounting class.“They’re both smart, hardworking guys who are going to be successful no matter what they do,” Barden says. “They’re salt-of-the earth people who are not just passionate about their future profession, they’re passionate about helping others in the community, which is really unique.”Townsend and Gutierrez say co-directing Camp Kesem has helped them develop skills in leadership, teamwork and goal-setting. But the biggest lesson, Gutierrez says, has to do with the resilience of the human spirit.“It’s been shocking to me to learn how strong these boys and girls are. … I was nothing like that when I was a kid,” he says.“They might only be 6 or 7 or 10, but they’re so strong they’re like super-heroes. It’s just an honor to work with them.”Executive EducationInspirationView all posts by T.D.

Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- October 22nd, 2019 -Academics,Corporate,Events,Faculty/Research\\nA panel of healthcare experts weighed in on the various “Medicare for All” proposals currently being considered in Congress and offered solutions of their own at a recentNaveen Jindal School of Managementseminar.\\nThe panel discussion, “Medicare for All: What Does It Really Mean?” was presented by the Jindal School’sCenter for Healthcare Leadership and Management. An audience of more than 150 early-rising students, faculty and healthcare professionals congregated in the Davidson Auditorium Oct. 7 for the 7:30 a.m. discussion.\\nDr. Forney Fleming, a clinical professor in theOrganizations, Strategy and International Managementacademic area and long-time director of the master’s program in healthcare leadership and management at the Jindal School, served as moderator. He began by laying out in stark terms the reason for having such a discussion, one that centered on the various proposals in play that would radically overhaul the healthcare system if enacted.\\nIn terms of gross domestic product or per capita, “we spend about twice as much for our healthcare as other well-developed countries do,” he said. “But what do we get for that expenditure? Well, unfortunately, in terms of overall quality, the United States ranks very poorly.”\\nRising healthcare costs — the average healthcare premium for a family of four is now in excess of $20,000 — combined with rising out-of-pocket increases, high deductibles and stagnant wage increases cause healthcare to become unaffordable for many Americans, Fleming said. Add to this problem the huge number of baby boomers who are added to the Medicare rolls at a rate of 10,000 per day. He said that all of these factors render the healthcare system economically unsustainable and explain why we are in a situation in which many Americans feel the need to entertain radical changes such as those being discussed daily on the campaign trail by presidential candidates.\\nDr. Paul Convery, a clinical professor inExecutive Educationat JSOM, described in detail the various flavors of Medicare-for-All bills that have been filed in the 116th U.S. Congress. Proposals include expansion of state- or Medicaid-subsidized individual premiums, tweaks to the current Affordable Care Act, Medicare buy-in for those 50 years or older (down from the current age of 65) and the single-payer national healthcare system proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders.\\n“It’s not surprising for me that Medicare-for-All or discussion of a national health insurance program is on the agenda this election cycle,” Convery said. “What is surprising is that it’s a major topic and — for the first time in 50 years — it has broad support and majority support across the American public.”\\nNext up, Steve Love, president and CEO of theDallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council, described the various Medicare-for-All proposals as simply a cry for help and urged caution in the discussion as well as a close look at the details.\\n“We’re all moving down this road of Medicare for All, and I’m not sure it’s really been looked at from a cost point of view and what all the ramifications are,” he said. “…[T]his is certainly the right goal — and the right goal is to lower healthcare costs and give coverage to [more] people and access [to more people] — but I’m not sure we’re going down the right path.”\\nLove said that transparency in healthcare costs and increasing access to healthcare rather than providing additional coverage is what people really need.\\n“If we can all work together and strive to come up with a solution that will answer these questions, it might be a good alternative to Medicare for All, and, in the long run, it may be cheaper,” he said.\\nDavid Toomey, senior vice-president atShareCare, a digital health-and-wellness engagement platform, concluded the presentation by offering an alternative solution to spiraling healthcare costs, namely, reducing waste. To lay it out, he focused on one particular healthcare issue — the wide variation among healthcare organizations in cost of treating back pain.\\nToomey described the lengthy, wasteful treatment process Starbucks baristas had to go through to treat the back pain from which they often suffer because they have to stand for much of their shifts. First, baristas scheduled an appointment with a doctor, then they waited, then they scheduled a follow-up with a specialist, then they waited again, then they had an MRI, then they got a review of the MRI, then they got a consultation with another specialist, then they saw a podiatrist, and then finally they started physical therapy.\\nSince patients ended up in physical therapy 83 percent of the time, Starbucks set up a treatment process by which their baristas went straight to a spine clinic and immediately began physical therapy. Doing so removed the waste by eliminating the inefficient parts of the process.',\n",
              "   '“I’m going to find the … really good doctors that are a part of a high-quality, Six-Sigma approach to healthcare,” he said. “[This is] free-market competition. We cannot wait for the government to fix healthcare. We’ve been talking about it forever, and it’s the same old, same old. I appreciate the hyperbole, but the reality is we can’t afford this.”\\nDuring the concluding question-and- answer session, the panelists were asked how pricing transparency could help solve the problem of out-of-control healthcare spending. Convery proposed a free-market system that is augmented by some sort of government regulation. He also pointed toSurgery Center of Oklahoma, a medical practice that lists its prices on its websites, as an example of how pricing transparency can work.\\n“If they can do it, it’s not undoable,” he said. “It’s not because we’re not smart enough. I think we’re smart enough to not make things transparent.”\\nWatch the videoof the Center for Healthcare Leadership and Management seminar, “Medicare for All: What Does It Really Mean?” on YouTube.\\nBS Healthcare ManagementExecutive MBAMS Healthcare Leadership and Management\\nView all posts by Jimmie Markham\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Alongside my team, we were able to provide our client Company with market entry strategies and conduct market research, and we were able to obtain a closer, in-depth look into the healthcare industry. Not only did my team members and I provide an in-depth market analysis and market entry strategies to our Company, but we were able to receive international experience which is incredibly invaluable. Being able to learn about different cultures and communication styles throughout the semester is what ultimately allowed us as a team to communicate effectively. Being in an international setting also calls for late nights or early mornings to meet with our Company at a time that works for everyone. Throughout the internship, I learned a few key lessons. One, is the importance of communication, not only with the company but within my team. Understanding that not everyone has the same communication style is crucial to acknowledge, and being able to adapt to where you can communicate effectively is a powerful skill. I also learned the importance of realizing that you will never know everything about a subject, there is always more research to be done. Knowledge is an area to be built upon, and it is okay to acknowledge that you do not know the answer to a question, and then research to reach the answer. The final key lesson is that there will always be challenges in the workplace – it is inevitable. It is how one approaches and confronts these challenges that will determine how much one grows as a result.To my group members thank you for your motivation and ambition to always go forward. Although we have not met in person yet, I can confidently say that you both have great strengths and a work ethic that will take you far.  Thank you to our mentor . . . . who has guided us continuously, provided feedback, and given so much of her time throughout this semester, our team truly appreciates it.

The company placed him in a job in Tokyo, where Limas now works as an assistant language teacher. In his role, he shares language skills with his students along with information about American culture and traditions. He credits opportunities to work on start-up business ideas at the Jindal School with expanding his understanding about how businesses work.\\nWhat do you enjoy about your current position/profession?\\nI enjoy experiencing a different culture in a different environment. I’ve always been fascinated with foreign countries and found myself fortunate enough to work in Japan. Perhaps my greatest joy about living in Japan is that I can be surrounded by Japanese animation every day.\\nHow do you see your profession changing in the next five or 10 years?\\nJapanese education is undergoing a major reform related to English language teaching. It’s increasing the amount of English testing and classes students must take. Japan believes its future is tied to the English language so right now is an excellent time to be a teacher.\\nWhat unexpected experience or event has shaped and/or influenced your current professional life?\\nI actually arrived in Japan one day before the mandated quarantine because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Japan, that blocked anyone from entering the country. The company I work for was very surprised I had made it into Japan just in time, as the rest of my colleagues were unable to get in. Because the situation had changed so fast, my original working location was changed from the city to a tropical volcano island called Miyakejima. It was the most surreal place I’ve ever seen and was like something out of a fantasy novel.\\nWhat is your favorite UT Dallas memory?\\nMy favorite memory was making friends in my last year at UT Dallas. We used to meet up on the weekends to watch anime together on campus. There was lots of pizza involved.\\nDid a UT Dallas professor inspire you? Who was that and how was that person inspirational?\\nDr. Britt Berrett, director of the bachelor’s program in Healthcare Management, inspired me the most. I felt like every day I was learning useful things that I couldn’t learn from anywhere else.

Is it important to know Japanese to do this job or can you do it without language expertise?\\nIt’s hard for me to say exactly how good my Japanese language skills are. Sometimes I understand and other times I have no idea what’s being said. I learned it by studying in my free time and through talking with those in my daily life. Knowing Japanese is not necessary for my job, however, English is rarely heard in Japan so daily life can be difficult without knowing the language. My students are always eager to chat with me, so using a mix of English and Japanese goes a long way.\\nWhat age group of students do you teach and where?\\nI was on Miyakejima for a few months, an island in the Pacific Ocean south of Yokohama, after which I moved back to the Japanese mainland. If anyone is looking for a tropical escape, Miyakejima is the perfect place. At the end March 2021, I will be moving to Saitama, the prefecture that neighbors Tokyo. I teach at public middle and elementary schools.

              "  'chunks': ['Two Tips To Set Your College Application Apart From The Competition\\nAlumni Spotlights\\nTestimonials\\nNewsletters\\nG.O.A.T. Podcast\\nbyKelcey Piper- October 16th, 2015 -College Knowledge,Joining JSOM\\nApplying for college may seem like a daunting task if you don’t start out on the right foot. You want to impress the admissions department, but you don’t want to over-embellish your application. When it comes to your college application, there is a fine line between showing you’re competent, versus showboating your skills excessively. These two key tips will help you wow the college admissions officers and stand out from other students.\\n1. Don’t Try Too Hard\\nMany students make the mistake of trying to write about what they think the admissions officer wants to read. This is one of the biggest mistakes you could make. While a story about your mission trip to Honduras may seem like good material for yourapplication essay, the truth is that admissions counselors read hundreds upon thousands of essays repeating the same story — or a close approximation of it. Your college application essay should showcase what matters to you, not what you think matters to the applications committee. So don’t try too hard; use your writing to display your creativity and ingenuity. You’ll be better off than if you wrote about a cookie-cutter experience.\\n2. Follow Instructions Exactly\\nIt always starts the same way: You’re on your fifth college application, and it seems painfully similar to the last four. You’re zooming through the instructions just to get to the end. That is time you most need to slow down and proceed with caution. While application instructions can seem generic and repetitive, they are put in place for a reason. Colleges want to see that you can take direction, so don’t skip a step just because it seems unnecessary and redundant. You may be unknowingly failing a test.\\nApplying for college is stressful enough — use these tips to help simplify the process.

Podcast\\nbyGlenda Vosburgh- April 11th, 2023 -Alumni,Development,Events\\nIt was an evening of sweet indulgences for 50 guests at the recent donor appreciation event recognizing supporters of theNaveen Jindal School of Management. Attendees were treated to a tour of the unique Sweet Tooth Hotel Flagship in downtown Dallas, an eclectic and colorful art museum that is the brainchild of JSOM alumna Jencey Keeton, BS’04.\\nThe March 30 event was hosted by members of the Jindal School’s Development and Alumni Relations department.\\nAlumnus Keith Fluellen, BS’96, treated attendees to an array of cupcakes, the hallmark of his company, Fluellen Cupcakes. The shop is across the street from the Sweet Tooth Hotel on Elm Street.\\nMembers of JSOM’s Advisory Board and other supporters gathered in the hotel’s Calirosa Cocktail Lounge, where they had the option of sampling a signature cocktail created for the event in an atmosphere of disco balls, brightly colored neon lights, and music.\\nThe Sweet Tooth Hotel opened in 2018 and features emerging experiential artists from Texas and nationwide. The exhibit, dubbed Dreamland, occupies separate rooms, covering 6,000 square feet. In addition, curated products are for sale in a gift shop. The venue is available to book events.\\nKeeton and her husband Cole also have a pop-up art exhibit, Rewind, at Watters Creek in Allen. She majored in fine arts and business at JSOM.\\n“The Jindal School is really important to me,” Keeton said. “I was on a full scholarship and would not have been able to go to school without it.”\\nKeeton’s father was an entrepreneur and she is following in his footsteps. While her father did not attend college, he recognized the value of education.\\n“I got a world-class education,” said Keeton, who earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration. “The business school is so well-rounded. I was able to pursue art and business. Going to school there was a personal experience. If I missed a class, my professor would check on me. I never felt alone at JSOM, even after I graduated.”\\nFluellen was a member of one the first freshman classes at the Jindal School, which began accepting freshmen and sophomores in 1992. He enrolled in 1993. Between 1975, when the School of Management was established, and 1992, only juniors, seniors and graduate students were admitted to UT Dallas.\\n“It was tough because they didn’t change the curriculum, but business is also tough,” he said. “I give credit to the school for preparing me for what I’m doing today. My time there was invaluable.”\\nAfter graduating, Fluellen worked for Bank of America and later in real estate, where he met the man from whom he ultimately purchased the cupcake business. It opened in 2011.\\nAnchi Ku, BS’81, who has served on the executive board of UT Dallas since 2000, was in attendance and won a chess set that was raffled to all potential donors at the event. She echoed Keeton’s belief that the school graduates well-rounded students.\\n“UTD provides an environment for students to have an education, but the school does produce well-rounded students,” said Ku, who earned a bachelor’s degree in business and public administration. “I think that we are unique in that.”']},\n",

I had schedule conflicts for Spring 2021, and I got responses from advisers right away to fix my issues. When I had a career crisis at the beginning of the fall semester, my adviser gave me insight as to what I needed to do and gave me advice on how I should tackle my problem.\\nWhat’s most surprising about college?\\nThe most surprising thing about college so far is how flexible my time is. This could be a double-edged sword. It could help you be more efficient with how much work you’re going to finish for classes, or it could also let you procrastinate.\\nHow have your personal goals changed since you’ve been at UTD?\\nMy personal goals changed drastically since I’ve been here. I was originally just an accounting major but now I’m also pursuing an ITS degree.

This is critical to your development, since asking questions will enhance your understanding of objectives and the task at hand.What is a class you enjoy and why?I am enjoying Medical Terminology.

If I decide to pursue a career in a hospital setting, knowing medical terms will allow me to better interact with doctors and staff, while also making good decisions that support the hospital.What is a class that was particularly hard that, in the end, you mastered?The hardest class I have taken so far was Financial Accounting. If you have never taken anything related to accounting, the course gets really difficult really quickly. In all honesty, it took me a while to find a way to comprehend this class, but I developed new study habits and began solving practice problems to get better at recognizing different accounting scenarios.

Podcast\\nbyGlenda Vosburgh- April 10th, 2024 -Events\\nArtificial intelligence technology and its effect on all aspects of business operations and management was the focus of the recentBiz AI Conferenceat theNaveen Jindal School of Management. Nearly 130 attended the March 29-31 event atThe University of Texas at Dallas.\\nDr. Harpreet Singh, an associate professor in theInformation Systems Areaat the Jindal School, and Rohit Aggarwal, a professor in Ois Operations and Info Systems at the University of Utah’s David Eccles School of Business co-chaired the event.\\nAI is rapidly entering various industries, yet its full potential remains largely untapped by users. According to conference organizers, AI has already led to accelerated changes that improve efficiency, cut costs, and optimize processes across multiple business functions, including marketing, sales, human resources and accounting. AI can automate routine tasks, enhance decision making and serve many other purposes.\\nThe conference was planned to inform attendees about AI’s many possible uses, as well as some of the biases against AI and the challenges.\\nConference sessions focused on a range of topics, including information from a study titled “AI and AI-human based Salesforce Hiring Using Conversational Interview Videos” byDr. Howard Dover, a clinical professor in theMarketing Areaand director of theCenter for Professional Salesat JSOM; Ishita Chakraborty, the University of Wisconsin-Madison; K. Sudhir, Yale School of Management; and Khai Chiong, an assistant professor in the Marketing Area at the Jindal School.\\nOne of the highlights of the conference was a panel discussion featuring EICs and senior editors from the top journals.\\nPanelists were professors Olivier Toubia, editor-in-chief (EIC) at Marketing Science; Suprateek Sarker, EIC at ISR; Ahmed Abassi, senior editor (SE), at ISR; Maytal Saar-Tsechansky, SE at MISQ; K. Sudhir, former EIC at Marketing Science; and Hemant Bhargava, deputy editor at Management Science.\\nA key point in their discussion was the challenge of researchers to submit their papers for publication fast enough to keep pace with rapid changes in AI.\\nThose attending the conference represented business schools at universities across the United States, including Jordana George, an assistant professor of information systems at Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School.\\n“I’m here to try to get my head around where academia is going and how business schools are going to make a difference using AI,” she said.\\nJindal School alumnus Kaiyue Liu, a graduate teaching assistant working toward a PhD in Information Systems and Operations Management at UT Arlington, attended the conference to let people know more about his research and network with other professionals. Liu received anMBAwith a business analyticsconcentrationfrom the Jindal School.\\n“I’m hoping to gain some exposure for my research and to have discussions about it with others,” he said.\\nSingh and others are working toward organizing the profusion of information from the conference in a central location. He described the event as “very successful.”\\n“This was the first year of the conference and we have had very positive responses from the community,” he said. “We hope it will serve as a nexus for business school researchers to discuss the transformative role of AI in modern business practices and its future implications.”']},\n",

Podcast\\nGood corporate governance can help private companies maneuver the snares of disruption, Jason Downing, vice chairman and U.S. leader of Deloitte Private, said recently at theNaveen Jindal School of Management. Those snares are caused by technological innovation and other pressing concerns of running a business in the 21st century.\\nDeloitte Private is the division of the Big Four firm that serves private companies, andDowningdelivered his remarks at a breakfast presented by theInstitute for Excellence in Corporate Governance.\\nHe provided the audience, comprised of institute members and guests, an overview of business trends and best practices based on aDeloitte Private surveyof more than 2,500 private-company executives from around the world.\\n“Today’s environment is constantly changing, and private companies, more than ever before, need to be nimble and prepared to address a variety of external influences,” Downing said. “Influences like innovation and disruption, changes in the regulatory environment, industry consolidation, shifts in consumer demands, geopolitical uncertainty and substantial technology advances.”\\nPrivate-Company Trends\\nAccording to Downing, there is a direct correlation between many of these external influences and key trends among private companies, and between external influences and the topics that are keeping private-company executives “up at night.”\\nTrends among private companies include adapting to disruption, which includes the implementation of new business models. Survey results showed 40 percent of private companies are devising new business models, and another 43 percent are considering doing so.\\nAdapting also means embracing technology, which, Downing said, goes hand-in-hand with disruption.\\nOther trends include dealing with risks associated with trade barriers and cyberattacks, overcoming market competition, focusing on acquiring a talented workforce and creating a strong corporate culture.\\n“Most companies believe that a strong corporate culture is foundational to their business — especially private companies,” he said. “Specifically, our study found that more than three-quarters of the survey respondents characterized culture as strategically important to the success of their company — with more than a third strongly agreeing with that sentiment.”\\nOne significant trend that Deloitte found from the survey is a sense of purpose among private companies.\\n“Profits are needed to sustain a family business, but they are derived, at least in part, by a sense of purpose that resonates with stakeholders across the spectrum — from customers to employees to people in the places where they operate,” he said.\\nThe conditions and trends found in the survey revealed the need for good governance in private companies, Downing said.\\nExternal forces, combined with related private-company trends, “create an increased focus on the role of the board at private companies,” he said. “More and more, private companies are embracing board governance and the structure and processes once seen primarily at public companies.”\\nAn engaged and strategic board, Downing said, provides substantial value to an organization by delivering benefits like independent thinking, new ideas and diverse perspectives on important topics.']},\n",

She joined up, got to work, studied hard and impressed more than a few professionals with her acumen and energy. This spring, she reaped what she has sown, earning both the campus-wide Student Diversity Award and the DFW American Marketing Association Collegiate Marketer of the Year award.\\n“Jessica has been an active leader on campus,” says Raul Hinojosa, director of community engagement in the UT Dallas Office of Diversity and Community Engagement. “She is an admired leader across campus. She pushes herself to be part of a diverse set of organizations and to take a genuine interest in people who are different from her.”\\nMunoz is the fifth Jindal School student to earn the Collegiate Marketer of the Year Award. Since Joshua Joseph, BS 2012, picked up the inaugural honor in 2012, JSOM marketing students have earned all but one of the competitive CMOY awards (seeJindal School CMOY Winnersbelow).\\nJindal School CMOY Winners\\nMunoz, who will graduate in 2018 with aBS in Marketingdegree from theNaveen Jindal School of Management, also earned admiration from Dr. Julie Haworth, the degree’s program director. “Her unique skills include her drive and professionalism, as well as her patience and warm personality,” Haworth says.\\n“I never imagined I would be able to attend college, so to be receiving these two awards is an extreme honor to me; and they motivate me to continue to work hard to accomplish my dreams,” Munoz says. “I want to help give hope to other students who may not believe that scholarships or getting recognitions in their field is possible for them.”\\nIn addition to her role as the vice president for programming of the campusAMA chapter, Munoz is involved in theSigma Lambda Gamma sororityon campus, where she serves as alumni relations chair. “As the largest Latina-founded, multicultural membership sorority in the nation, we strive to empower women of all backgrounds by honoring our five principles of academics, community service, cultural awareness, social interaction, and morals and ethics,” Munoz says.\\n“I have admired her drive to learn more about people from other cultures,” Hinojosa says. “She and her sorority sisters have played a big role in helping create a thriving and active Latino community of students at UT Dallas.”\\nMunoz interns with theAssociation of Persons Affected by Addiction, a Dallas addiction recovery program. She manages its website and is assisting with the upcoming jazz benefit concert. Down the road, she plans to use her marketing degree to help those starting their own businesses. “In five years, I would like to be a manager for a small business so that I can have experience in what it feels like to run my own business and get operational and administrative experience,” she says. “In 15 years, I would like to have my own marketing business that targets small businesses and startups begun by minority business owners and women. I want to help them market not only their products and services but also themselves.”\\nFor now, Munoz remains focused on being the best at UT Dallas that she can be, in a place where she feels at home, acknowledging support she has received from professors, especially Haworth and Keith Dickinson, a marketing adjunct lecturer.\\n“I can’t express in words how much UT Dallas has contributed to this success,” Munoz says. “I have received a tremendous amount of mentoring. … The classes are designed to prepare you to apply the concepts in a real-world setting, which is what I am doing now in my internship, and I continue to attend all the networking events to stay updated in my field. I feel like a part of this community.”\\nMore from Rotator\\nAmerican Heart Association to Honor Associate Dean for Community Impact\\nAccounting Students Score Scholarships from the Texas Society of CPAs\\nBig Idea Competition Finals Will Put Kawasaki’s Art of Innovation on Display\\nThe iPhone X:  Will it pop or will it fizzle?\\nJindal School Alumna Earns Women in Technology Award\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Ford Jr., emeritus professor of organizations, strategy and international management, reminded the audience that the school already has experience with the continents: as early as a 1981 trip to Egypt and as recently as a 2016 trip to East Africa.\\nSpirited music filled the dining hall as Ford showed images of past trips, showing a mix of exposure to culture and business.\\n“Remember, these trips we’re working on, just like in the past, don’t have to be just for students,” he said. “They can be for businesspeople and the community. If people are going to embark on business there, an early part of it is going. See the opportunities for yourself.”\\nNegatu agreed with Ford. “Start with facts,” he said. “Learn as much as you can. People in Africa want to know you’ve taken the time to understand how they live and what their culture is about. And the differences between countries or even within a country.\\n“Also, can you handle having the water off sometimes or electricity sometimes not working? It’s as much about your own limits as anything else. Also, network. That could be working with [a nongovernmental agency]. Learn from the people who have run it, and you might find jobs and lots of potential.”\\nDr. Habte Woldu, director of theMS in International Management Studiesprogram at the Jindal School, believes part of the journey can even begin before you ever enter the continent.\\n“It can start as simply as meeting people from Africa here in Dallas,” Ethiopia-born Woldu said. “You’ll be surprised by how many want to share their experiences. Making up your mind from what you just think you know about Africa can really hold you back. Spend some time with people who understand the place firsthand. For that, you don’t even need a plane ticket to get you started. …You just need an open mind.”\\nCenter for Global BusinessGlobal Business\\nView all posts by Eric Butterman\\nMore from Corporate - News Category\\nNew Jindal School Lab Harnesses the Power of AI\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nThanks(for)giving Reception Celebrates Jindal School’s Donors\\nJindal School's Tina T.

              "  'chunks': ['Retiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nAlumni Spotlights\\nTestimonials\\nNewsletters\\nG.O.A.T. Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- February 18th, 2025 -Academics,Faculty/Research\\nDr. John McCracken, a clinical professor in theNaveen Jindal School of Managementand founder/director of theAlliance for Physician Leadership, retired Feb. 1 after more than 28 years of exemplary service. A retirement celebration was held that day. Guests included APL alumnus and former U.S. Congressman Michael C. Burgess, MS’2000, as well as many of McCracken’s current and former colleagues and students, all of whom agree that Dr. McCracken’s impact on them — and the healthcare industry — has been profound.\\nAPL is an umbrella term for variousExecutive Educationgraduate degree programs (EMBA, MS, EMBA/MS double degree) in the Jindal School that are designed with physicians in mind, Originally known as the Alliance for Medical Management Education, its first class of physicians graduated in 2000. The name was changed in 2018, McCracken said, to reflect the program’s long-standing emphasis on the development of effective physician-led organizational leadership. Since most healthcare organizations operate as businesses, but medical schools rarely teach business skills, the program was designed to fill that gap.\\n“Today, over 75% of doctors are employed by a corporate entity,” McCracken said.\\nAs the oldest continuous University-based physician leadership program in the U.S. that leads to an MBA, the APL is in a league of its own, saidDr. Paul Convery, an M.D. and clinical professor in the Jindal School.\\n“When John first developed the program in the 1990s, there were a few other major universities that had physician-only MBA Programs,” he said.\\xa0“They have all since either ceased or had significant interruptions. At the time, the concept of physicians as business partners and leaders in healthcare, aside from academics, was relatively new.\\xa0 Physicians had always been in leadership roles as department heads, leaders of groups and medical staff leaders in hospitals, but the new models of healthcare as a business, including hospital mergers, acquisitions of physician groups by non-physician healthcare entities and the increased role of healthcare insurance companies as ‘managed care’ called for a new skill set for physicians to acquire.\\xa0John provided the answer.”\\nMcCracken said he is proud that the program has gained a national reputation, attracting senior physicians from 28 states, and has become selective with a 12-18 month waiting list.\\n“Probably the most satisfying thing for me, though, has been the opportunity to remain in touch over the years with many of the more than 530 physician graduates,” he said. “They occasionally reach out with updates on their careers and to discuss thoughts on how to deal with challenges they may be facing.”\\nDr. Omesh Singh, a doctor of internal medicine and the associate chief medical officer of theCentre for Neuroskillsand chairman of the board ofTIOPA, Inc., graduated from the APL with an MBA in 2024. He said McCracken has a thought-provoking approach that, for him, went beyond the fundamentals of business.\\n“He showed me how to integrate these principles into my journey as a medical leader,” Singh said. “Dr. McCracken has dedicated his life and expertise to cultivating an environment that not only sharpened my skills but also helped me see the leader within myself — one I hadn’t fully recognized before. Through his mentorship, I’ve gained a strong foundation and an invaluable network, equipping me to navigate the complexities of my career with confidence. From refining my speaking and organizational skills to becoming proficient in financial statements, Dr. McCracken’s guidance has transformed me — both professionally and personally. I am forever grateful.”\\nMcCracken said the APL was started to teach practicing physicians not just business and administrative skills, but also leadership. The success of the program, he said, has been the result of the hard work and dedication of an outstanding faculty.\\n“We’ve tried to instill in our students the importance of attitudes and behaviors — and not just clinical competency — in leadership success,” he said. “Personal autonomy and clinical skills are core values of physicians, but leadership success in a physician organization requires above all the consent and cooperation of the doctors. That is very much influenced by a leader’s attitudes and behaviors.”\\nOne of his students isJulie Riley, MD, FACS,professor of urology, Hal Reed Black Endowed Chair of Urology, urology residency program director and vice chair of the Department of Urology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, in Little Rock, Ark. She will graduate in May with an MBA/MS double degree.\\n“From participation with Dr. McCracken and the APL program, I have learned to be more effective in communication with staff, colleagues, and trainees,” she said. “I have created an entire curriculum to the practice of medicine that incorporates many of the business principles learned over my time at UT Dallas. The program has also taught me strong purpose and direction in my career, and I can see the path I need to be on to achieve my goals.”\\nOne of the biggest challenges McCracken’s physician students have faced when learning to navigate the business side of healthcare is acquiring the soft leadership skills of influence, negotiation and motivating others.\\n“We’ve had the benefit of excellent program faculty who have been able to successfully help our graduates develop those skills, as is evidenced in their post-graduation success.” McCracken said. “The majority have gone on to senior leadership roles in the nation’s hospitals, health systems, managed care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and even the U.S. Congress.”\\nConvery said that, over the years, the physician leaders that have been through the APL have gone on to success in every area of healthcare from academic institutions to nationally recognized healthcare executives to becoming successful entrepreneurs.\\n“I have had the privilege of working with John for the past 10 years and every day, I am impressed by his vision, his integrity, his work ethic and his tireless dedication,” Convery said. “He is truly one of a kind and will be always remembered at the Jindal School as the originator of healthcare as a management track in the school.”\\nRiley said that McCracken has left an impact on all of his students.\\n“The students have true emotion on the lasting change that the program and John have left on us,” she said. “We each have a community of physicians to collaborate, support and challenge each other to influence the healthcare environment. For me personally, this spreads to the residents I train, the students I inspire and my fellow colleagues that I work with every day to give hope to a struggling healthcare system. I can thank APL and Dr. John McCracken (with his other faculty) for this.”\\nDon Taylor, a professor of practice in the Jindal School, was hired as APL director in 2022 when McCracken decided to step down and focus his efforts on teaching and mentoring.\\n“John has been right there, supportive of me throughout the journey, even in his first transition from director of the program, then into his faculty role, and now in his supporting role,” Taylor said. “He’s been very good about supporting my decisions as I try to navigate the changes in the industry. We now have different generations of physicians, different demographics of physicians, much different than when John started.”\\nTaylor said that he does not think even McCracken envisioned what the program would become when he started it.\\n“We are so unique amongst the physician graduate space and I’m talking business education in leadership development,” Taylor said. “Sometimes when people ask me what this program is all about, I say we’re a physician leadership program that, oh, by the way, gives an MBA as well. And the docs resonate with that.”\\nTaylor said that he is seeing more and more APL graduates wanting to give back to the program and volunteer whenever they can because of the way the program has impacted their lives.']},\n",
              " 414: {'url': 'https://jindal.utdallas.edu/news/study-by-jindal-school-researcher-exposes-inequalities-in-sba-disaster-loan-approvals/',\n",
              "  'chunks': ['The team investigated disaster loans from the Small Business Administration, which provides relief to small businesses and entrepreneurs. Their findings shine a harsh spotlight on the agency’s approach: a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t always work.\\n“It all comes down to how the SBA’s rules work,” Gurun said. “Imagine you’re at a store where everything has to be sold at exactly $10, no more, no less. Some items might be worth that price, but others might be too risky to sell at that price, so the store just won’t stock them at all. The SBA works similarly with their loans. Unlike regular banks, who can charge higher interest rates to people they see as riskier borrowers, the SBA can’t do that. They offer the same rate to everyone. So instead of being able to offer a higher rate to someone they see as a riskier borrower, they have to just say “no” completely. It’s like being told you can’t buy the item at all, rather than being offered it at a different price.”\\nGurun compared the SBA’s fixed-rate policy in which everyone gets the same interest rate, no matter their financial situation, to a gym membership.\\n“Imagine a gym that sets one very high bar for everyone to jump over,” he said. “While it seems fair that everyone faces the same challenge, it means people who could do well with a lower bar never get a chance to participate at all.”\\nSimilarly, Gurun said, when the SBA offers just one interest rate, they have to be very selective about which loans it approves.\\n“They do this to protect themselves from losing money on risky loans,” he said. “A regular bank would simply charge higher rates for riskier borrowers, like setting different jump heights for different skill levels. But since the SBA can’t adjust their rates, they end up turning away people who could have managed loan payments at a higher interest rate.”\\nAccording to the study’s findings this approach hits especially hard in communities that have historically faced credit challenges. Instead of getting a more expensive loan that they still could handle, these borrowers get no loan at all.\\n“A policy meant to treat everyone equally actually ends up shutting out the very communities it should be helping,” Gurun said. “Risk-insensitive pricing — charging the same interest rate to all approved loans — can unintentionally create and worsen inequities in access to credit. For disaster loan programs to be both more equitable and efficient, they should consider a balanced approach that incorporates some elements of risk-sensitive pricing while maintaining affordability.”\\nGurun said that for areas with lower-risk borrowers, approval rates for SBA loans are about 4 percentage points higher than comparable private market lending such as Federal Housing Administration home improvement loans. However, communities in the top quartile of minority share of the population — which statistically have higher credit risk and have been traditionally underserved — have approval rates that are about 6 percentage points lower than the comparable private market benchmark.\\nWhat changes to the SBA’s loan program would help more people in disaster-hit areas get approved?\\nFirst, Gurun said, the agency could create a tiered system for interest rates.\\n“This is kind of like how concert venues offer different ticket prices for different seats,” he said. “Instead of having just one rate that either works for you or doesn’t, they could offer a few different rates. This way, if someone doesn’t qualify for the lowest rate, they might still get approved at a slightly higher rate instead of being turned away completely.”\\nSecond, he said, they could create special support for higher-risk borrowers who really need help.\\n“Think of it like having a co-signer on a loan, but in this case, it’s the government providing extra backing,” he said. “This would let the SBA help more people while still keeping the program financially stable – like having a safety net that lets you help more people without risking the whole program.”\\nThe team was not surprised about the findings of the study, having begun their research expecting the data to reveal that higher-risk borrowers had a harder time getting loans.\\n“This wasn’t shocking because we’ve seen similar patterns before when studying price controls in other markets,” Gurun said. “It’s like when rent control sometimes leads to fewer available apartments. But what really caught us off guard was just how big the differences were. It’s one thing to predict a gap in approval rates but seeing just how many people were being left out of the program was eye-opening. The size of these differences suggests that what might look like a small quirk in how the program is designed can have huge real-world impacts on who gets help after a disaster and who doesn’t.”\\nThe study reveals that the loan-denial patterns found in the study create a domino effect that impacts everyone in communities whose businesses cannot access disaster loans.\\n“Think of it like a neighborhood where some houses can’t get repaired after a hurricane,” Gurun said. “Families that can’t get loans might have to leave their homes for longer periods — or permanently — because they can’t afford repairs. They might have to crash with relatives or move to different cities entirely.”\\nAs the dominoes continue to fall, they start affecting the entire community.\\n“When several houses stay damaged, it’s harder for nearby businesses to reopen because their customer base has scattered,” Gurun said. “Property values might drop. The local tax base shrinks, making it harder for the city to fund basic services. And here’s the really tough part: this often hits hardest in communities that were already struggling before the disaster. So instead of a disaster loan program helping communities bounce back, the way loans are approved — or denied — can actually make some neighborhoods take longer to recover than others. It’s like having a life raft, but not everyone who needs it can reach it.”\\nGurun said that the SB can benefit from partnering with the private sector and adopting some of its practices, such as risk-sensitive pricing, to broaden its approval base.\\n“Notably, other SBA programs such as regular small business lending and the Paycheck Protection Program are administered by private lenders,” he said. “Leveraging their expertise and established networks could potentially enhance both the speed and effectiveness of disaster response efforts. A collaborative approach between private lenders and the SBA could pave the way for hybrid models that balance fairness with financial sustainability.”\\nFor potential applicants, a key takeaway from the study is that the current SBA disaster loan program may be more challenging to access in certain communities, particularly those with higher minority populations or more subprime borrowers.\\n“Applicants should be aware of these potential challenges and consider casting a broader net to secure funding for rebuilding and recovery,” Gurun said.\\nAccounting\\nView all posts by Jimmie Markham\\nMore from Faculty/Research - News Category\\nProfessor Milind Dawande Remembered at Jindal School Event\\nJindal School Ranks No. 6 Worldwide in FT Research Productivity Rankings\\n2025 UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings™']},\n",

              "  'chunks': [\"Q: What should a student focus on more – statistics or programming?\\nQ: What is the hardest part of this course?\\nSmart data scientists don’t just solve big, hard problems; they also have an instinct for making big problems small.”― D.J. Patil, Data Jujitsu: The Art of Turning Data into Product\\nThat’s a good quote right there, but whoever has taken up UTD’s MIS 6359 course like me knows very well that it’s easier said than done. MIS 6359 is Advanced Statistics for Data Science, and those who have an affinity for statistics can nail it pretty well.\\nSuppose you’re planning on taking it for your master’s; welcome to Tier One of crunching numbers. As someone who majored in computer science during her undergrad and had minimal interaction with math, I initially was a little intimidated by it. However, things began to change when I paid attention to the details.\\nYou know what they say, “If you ask a stupid question, you may feel stupid; if you don’t ask a stupid question, you remain stupid.” It took a lot of help from my friends and asking (possibly) stupid questions regarding the lectures and the course, in general. Understanding the concepts became comparatively easy at a slow but steady pace.\\nI’m not a seasoned scholar in advanced statistics now, don’t get me wrong, but I have grown to respect the subject and have fun with it. So now I’m sharing some knowledge straight from the professor,Dr. Rasoul Ramezani, to help students like myself hopefully.\\nThis course is best suited for students who possess preliminary knowledge of statistics or have taken at least one statistics course during their undergrad. The course focuses on basics initially but quickly descends into more complex levels of difficulty, which makes it challenging.\\nAdvanced Statistics for Data Science is an excellent course for those interested in pursuing careers as data analysts or researchers in any area dealing with data, from social studies to finance. The contents of this course equip students with enough knowledge to help them apply these concepts with any real-life data.\\nAs a professor teaching this course, I consider data science the heart of the process wherein complex and messy data is transformed into user-friendly, interpretable, and understandable outputs that make it easy for humans to comprehend.\\nI suggest they have a good understanding of calculus, algebra and get the hang of the basics of understanding the relationship between variables in statistics. If the students are knowledgeable in the mentioned concepts, they’re good to go.\\nThe students first need to develop strong proficiency in the basics of statistics ab initio and make their way up to becoming good statisticians. In the meantime, they also need to learn programming in different platforms such as RStudio, MATLAB, SAS, etc. Being adept in programming without understanding the meaning of the inputs and outputs is useless. That is why it’s important to start understanding the basics of statistics and work your way through its depths with practice.\\nThe most challenging part of this course is understanding the relationship between the theory explained in class and its application to real-life scenarios. Students can overcome this with practice and mindfulness when solving problems related to the concept.\\nNow that you’ve read words of wisdom from someone who has been practicing this subject for years, I hope some of your doubts are put to rest. You can ask further questions or seek guidance from Professor Ramezani by emailing him atRasoul.Ramezani@utdallas.edu.\\nFuture StudentsGraduateStudent Experience\\nAbout Maria Chintirala\\nGraduate ITMstudentMaria is currently a graduate student in the program of Information Technology and Management.

In recent years, GLEMBA has drawn participants from 22 countries who have worked in business areas ranging from banking, energy and healthcare to information technology, manufacturing, real estate and supply chain management.\\nStudents appreciate that they can draw on that wealth of differences, Bush said.\\nBut they also like the program’s flexibility — that they can individualize content to meet personal goals, she said, set it up to complete the degree in as few as 21 months and add one or more concentrations in specialized topics, from business analytics and finance, to organizational consulting, strategic human resources and transformational leadership.\\n“We also are proud of our record in attracting more and more women to the program,” Bush said. “Last fall, 49% of new students were women.

An internship is a great way to learn additional skills and accumulate work experience.\\nThere are two organizations offering professional certifications. TheHR Certification Institute (HRCI)offers the Professional in Human Resources (PHR). It is available to candidates with a bachelor’s degree and two years of relevant experience. TheSociety for Human Resources (SHRM)offers the Certified Professional SHRM-CP. It is available to candidates with an HR-related degree and one year of experience OR to graduates of human resource management programs (during their senior year) recognized as being in alignment with SHRM’s curriculum guidelines. Because the Jindal School’s BS in HRM program has been recognized as being in alignment, our students can sit for the SHRM-CP exam during their senior year. To support this, the Jindal School offers as an elective the SHRM certification preparation course.\\nBoth certifications are recognized within the profession as useful credentials. UT Dallas and the Jindal School have no preference for either and support students in their pursuit of one or both. The primary difference is that SHRM enables select students to take the exam while still in school, whereas HRCI does not.\\nHR professionals are expected to translate business strategies into people plans, ensuring the organization has the talent needed to execute the business strategy.\\nAdditionally, HR professionals proactively interact with employees at all levels to understand their perspectives and ensure that their concerns are addressed in a fair and expeditious manner.\\nHR professional monitor the professional environment for new developments and trends in human resources that may affect the organization.\\nHR is responsible for ensuring that the organization is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations at local, state and federal levels.\\nHR professionals Lead efforts to acquire and develop talent in the organization, including recruiting, on-boarding, training and ongoing learning.\\nHR professionals develop performance measurement and total rewards systems that ensure employees are focused on priority activities and are appropriately rewarded for accomplishing those activities.\\nLastly, HR is the principal change agent in the organization, leading and managing efforts to change and adapt to new threats and opportunities.\\nHuman Resource Management (HRM) is the discipline that focuses on the people side of most organizations. HRM responsibilities include but are not limited to talent acquisition, learning and development, compensation and benefits, labor law, employment law, employee relations and change management.\\nHuman Resources (HR) also is responsible for ensuring the organization is in compliance with applicable employment laws, labor laws and agreements.\\nMost notably, HR is responsible for ensuring that the organization assigns people in the precise numbers, with the required knowledge, skills and abilities needed. These assignments need to be closely correlated to execute the organization’s business strategy.\\nPeople are at the heart of every organization. Leaders confirm this, and share that HR is probably the most difficult area in the organization to get right. When HR gets it correct, the organization gains the opportunity to grow and prosper along with its employees, customers and communities.\\nThe student chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) at UT Dallas is a college-level affiliate of SHRM, a professional organization that serves the needs of HR professionals and advances the practice of human resource management. The SHRM at UT Dallas chapter is student managed and brings in HR professionals from the community to offer new insights into the practice of HR. SHRM at UT Dallas has been recognized for exemplary merit several times in the past few years. The SHRM at UT Dallas chapter supports mentoring programs with new career professionals, provides pro bono HR support to small organizations, and conducts fundraising events to support itself. Members of the SHRM at UT Dallas chapter attend SHRM Dallas chapter luncheons and attend SHRM national conventions.\\nFAQ Categories\\nAdmission Requirements/Procedures']},\n",

              "  'chunks': ['It has been 30 years since the world’s attention was captured by massive student-led protests in Beijing, China’s Tiananmen Square. They lasted from April 15, 1989, to June 4, 1989, when the Chinese government declared martial law and sent in the military.\\nIn what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military’s advance. Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded.\\nTank Man is the nickname of an unidentified Chinese man who stood in front of a column of tanks leaving Tiananmen Square on June 5. He was never identified and, having been led from the street by another unidentified man, his fate is not known.\\nThe protests and deaths at Tiananmen Square have been omitted from China’s history, Peters said. “When I’ve screened the film for students from mainland China, their response has been that the footage of [the real] Tank Man is fake. It never happened.”\\nWhile Peters did not believe his film changed their minds, he hoped it had at least planted a question in their minds and that they will do their own investigation into the event.\\nPeters recently spent time in Hong Kong, where he marched with protestors. He made comparisons to the dissent in that city today and the dissent in Beijing in 1989. “In fact, Hong Kong holds an annual public vigil to honor what happened in Tiananmen Square,” he said.\\nWhen mainland China moved to pass an extradition bill requiring Hong Kong’s citizens charged with a crime to be sent to China for trial, the citizens of Hong Kong poured into the streets in protest. “One million people in Hong Kong, out of only a total population of 7 million, marched,” Peters said.\\nHis appearance for CAFÉ was part of its mission of teaching business students about the free-enterprise system, including the importance of personal freedoms. CAFÉ, which was started at JSOM about two years ago, hosts one event per semester. Past events have featured journalist and political satirist P.J. O’Rourke and a panel of economists representing different universities.\\n“With this program, we are trying to counter a lack of knowledge about economic systems, with particular emphasis on free-enterprise systems,” Villarreal said. “A lot of business school students graduate without knowing anything about the history of economics. We also hope to teach them about the importance of history. It’s impossible to know where we are going if we don’t know where we’ve been.”\\nBS FinanceBS Global BusinessMS FinanceMS Financial Engineering and Risk ManagementMS International Management StudiesPhD International Management Studies\\nView all posts by Glenda Vosburgh\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

She wanted to get into human resources to cap off her professional career but knew she would need additional credentials to make that transition. She also wanted to become a professional coach; so she decided to start down that path by enrolling in the certificate program inExecutive Educationat the Jindal School, which she completed in 2010.\\n“Living in Allen, I knew The University of Texas at Dallas has a great reputation, and I knew I wanted to be in an accredited program related to organizational consulting and behavior,” she said. “The certificate program at the Jindal School allowed me to learn about the various different coaching models and allowed me to network with a lot of people.”\\nAs she considers herself a lifelong learner, Payne said enjoyed the certificate experience — so much so that she went on to earn hermaster’s degree in management scienceat JSOM. She credits being enrolled in the graduate program for gaining her entry into a major human resources project at American Airlines and then into similar assignments at BCBS. From there, she landed her current role, which she considers the most fulfilling role of her career.\\n“As CEO, getting that certificate from the Jindal School gave me some insights into what’s required when my boards and I discuss fiduciary responsibility.It really helped me help them.”   — Patti Niles, president and CEO, Southwest Transplant Alliance\\nAs CEO, getting that certificate from the Jindal School gave me some insights into what’s required when my boards and I discuss fiduciary responsibility.It really helped me help them.”   — Patti Niles, president and CEO, Southwest Transplant Alliance\\nNiles took a similar path to gaining the tools she needed to succeed in her role leading a company that recovers transplant organs and tissues for 10.5 million residents across 89 counties in Texas and one in Arkansas. Since the organization she leads operates with a governing board and an advisory board, she wanted to gain knowledge related to those interactions.\\n“As CEO, getting that certificate from the Jindal School gave me some insights into what’s required when my boards and I discuss fiduciary responsibility,” she said. “It really helped me help them.

Thank you so much.”\\nGenerosity Helps Fulfill Visions\\nJohnson introducedDr. Rafael Martín, vice president and chief of staff ofThe University of Texas at Dallas. Martín, himself a scholarship recipient, thanked the donors for their generosity and described how the venue for the breakfast — the Davidson-Gundy Alumni Center — had been a COVID-19 vaccination site in which 49,000 doses had been administered. Funds to build it were donated by JSOM alumniNancy Gundy Davidson, BS’80, and Chuck Davidson, MS’80.\\n“It shows that when people like the Davidsons are generous and have some vision for a facility like this, you never know what’s going to come out of it,” Martín said. “It’s part of a tradition of leaders of our University that have shown vision — starting, of course, with our founders,Eugene McDermott, Eric Johnson, Cecil Green… the founders of this institution that really envisioned a university that would train top talent and serve North Texas through research, education and cultural programs. … I think we’re well on our way to fulfilling that vision.”\\nDr. Diane McNulty, associate dean for external relations, communications and corporate development at the Jindal School, emceed the event. She explained that the previous year’s breakfast necessarily had gone virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even so, the event won the Jindal School’s External Relations team the 2021 Event Marketing of the Year Award from the Dallas/Fort Worth chapter of the American Marketing Association.\\n“Our team did an outstanding job despite the challenges of the pandemic,” McNulty said. “Our donors and sponsors rose to the occasion and the results were more financial support for our students when they needed it the most.”\\nThe Beck Group, Deloitte and Lennox were presenting sponsors of the breakfast this year. Altair Global, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, Capital One, Fujitsu, Goldman Sachs, Dr. Sydney Smith Hicks, HM&M, Home Light, Intuit, Jindal School Executive Education, Intuit, Merit Energy Company, Palomino Capital, Amber Rao, Retail & Restaurant Growth Capital, Riveron, Texas Instruments, TFOA, Toyota and Vistra also sponsored the event.\\nView all posts by Jimmie Markham\\nMore from Alumni - News Category\\nJindal School Alumnus Creates Innovative Solution for Chronic-Pain Management\\nJindal School Alumni Reunion: More Than 700 Alumni Gather for Fun and Connections\\nDipak Jain Named as Jindal School’s Inaugural Eminent PhD Alumnus\\nA dog-eared letter dated April 7, 1982, is so important to Dr. Dipak C.

The former healthcare executive shared the inside story of the massive accounting fraud that crippled outpatient healthcare giant HealthSouth.\\nThe conference, co-sponsored by the School of Management’s Center for Internal Auditing, featured a cross-section of government and law enforcement representatives who gathered to discuss the latest in fraud trends, schemes and prevention techniques.\\nBeam, himself a convicted felon, learned his lesson the hard way after working for Richard Scrushy, the former HealthSouth CEO accused of ordering his employees to “cook the books.”\\nBeam had barely started his first day of work when Scrushy asked him to sit in on a contract presentation to Scrushy’s boss. During the meeting, Scrushy told his boss, “Aaron and I worked on this contract last night for hours,” Beam said.\\n“I didn’t know what to think. I hadn’t been to work for 30 minutes and I’d already been included in a lie,” Beam recalled. “Today, looking back, I realize that at that very moment, Richard Scrushy was probably testing me to see what kind of player I was and how I’d react to being included in a lie.”\\nDrawing on his recently published book, HealthSouth: The Wagon to Disaster, Beam recounted lessons learned. The book looks at the meteoric rise and colossal collapse of HealthSouth –  from a two-room office, to a global corporation with more than 2,200 facilities, to the $2.7 billion accounting fraud that landed Beam in prison.\\nThe fraud, he said, took everything he had, including his  25-acre “Beam Acres” estate outside Mobile, Ala., with a million-dollar home, tennis and basketball courts, regulation-size football field and a music stage. He has gone from a CFO earning $500,000 a year to running his own one-man, lawn-care business in Alabama\\n“I didn’t know what to think. I hadn’t been to work for 30 minutes and I’d already been included in a lie,” Beam recalled.\\nAaron Beam,former CFO\\nAfter working together at Lifemark Corp. in Houston, Beam joined Scrushy in forming HealthSouth, built on a new concept dreamed up by Scrushy. It expanded quickly, and Scrushy’s charisma and salesmanship propelled its growth and stock price.\\n“He was very much the darling of Wall Street,” Beam said. “It was quite impressive to see Richard Scrushy perform. I remember many times we would go present at investor conferences. Richard would make his presentation, and I’d watch the investors leave, make calls in the lobby, and the stock would go up 1, 2 and 3 points. It was like if you knew when Richard Scrushy was speaking, you had insider information.”\\nScrushy, Beam said, became “an ego on steroids,” adding that the CEO quit wearing a watch because “it was always whatever time Richard wanted it to be.”']},\n",

AIF has found that partnering with members of the communities it serves is the key. “There are different ways to bring about change,” Raghavendra said, “but change can be sustained when the community is invested in it.”\\nHe focused on two AIF programs in India that are showing positive results — mitigating the impact of seasonal migration on children and improving survival rates of newborn babies and their mothers.\\nHe described seasonal migration as a “mega problem” in India. “Rural families migrate for work, and when the parents leave they take the children with them. Sometimes whole villages move,” Raghavendra said. “The children then are not learning, and sometimes they are even pressed into working.”\\nAIF has established seasonal hostels at work sites so that the children can attend school. It also has trained members of the community to be teachers so that the children may stay behind and be taught and cared for while their parents migrate for work.\\nAIF uses the same model in programs to promote survival of mothers and their babies. People in the community are trained in areas such as nutrition in order to share that expertise with new mothers — in their villages and others.\\nThe 3C event culminated with a celebration dinner at the Hyatt Regency in Richardson with keynote speaker, Debjani Mukherjee Biswas, a Jindal School 1993 MS alumna, who spoke on the topic of diversity and gender equity.

The world is changing, people are changing, preferences are changing and society is changing. With all those changes, our role as an educator also changes. And when our roles change, there are different goals, both tactical and strategic, that we have at an institutional level. That requires very focused leadership.\\nShekhar said he will rely on the Jindal School’s alumni base of more than 65,000 graduates to help the school put those goals into focus.\\n“Every time somebody hires a graduate of ours or mentors them or makes a connection that eventually helps the school, those things are done through individuals,” he said. “A lot of them are alumni. So, in terms of focusing on the life cycle of a student in both the academic as well as non-academic side — the life cycle of the student, starting with prospective students and then supporting them until they become alumni — that’s what I will do.”\\nShekhar, who serves on multiple boards, including the US-India Chamber of Commerce, Chinese Institute of Engineers DFW, Tableau, Alteryx and Peoplecert, and advises multiple student organizations, said he will also focus on institutional partnerships, industry partnerships and student organizations to give Jindal School students leadership experience.\\nAs for Powell, she embarks on the next chapter of her life knowing that the Jindal School is in good hands.\\n“It is incredibly reassuring to me knowing that the talent that has been tapped to come behind me is bringing the caliber of expertise in the areas that are so important for the school,” she said. “From a graduate program’s perspective, you’re looking at two individuals who have considerable years of service and leadership experience. My job ended up being bigger than me and I’m really glad that there’s more than one individual coming in to take on that challenge.”\\nPowell said that Thouin brings all the skills and experience required to take on the academic policy and program management side of the graduate programs. Shekhar, she said, brings experience as a Jindal School student and member of the Dean’s Graduate Council, corporate experience and experience as a director of a successful program.\\n“By combining these two individuals and the expertise that they bring to their jobs, it is a remarkable opportunity that graduate programs don’t often have,” Powell said. “They will team up to advance the Jindal School’s graduate programs to a whole new level.”\\nAlumniMS Business Analytics and Artificial IntelligenceMS Information Technology and Management\\nView all posts by Jimmie Markham\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Featured guest speakers included Bill Jackson, regional vice president of Texas Mutual’s Dallas office, and Steven Badger, a partner at Zelle LLP in Dallas.\\nJackson introduced a new course,Risk Control and Safety Engineering (FIN 4336), to forum attendees. This course is exclusive to UT Dallas and only offered at the Jindal School, thanks to the partnership between the Jindal School and Texas Mutual. Badger gave a presentation on his decade spent leading subrogation action arising from the 9/11 terrorist attacks (the litigation was settled for $1.2 billion).The Insurance Recordreported on the forum in both its print andonlinemagazines.\\nMS in Finance Program\\nEach semester, the MS in Finance program holds several enrichment events for students to meet alumni and industry professionals, learn about finance industry trends and enhance their professional skills.\\nFinance Internship Roundtable\\nAt the Finance Internship Roundtable held in September, three MS in Finance international students, Uruba Andaleeb, Hamza Raza Jaffery and Wan Yee Lau, shared their 2018 summer internship experiences. They also reflected on their internship job searching, interview techniques and skill sets necessary to help students, especially international students, gain a clearer view of professionalism in the finance field.\\nDay in the Life of a Financial Analyst\\nIn October, the program held a panel discussion on “A Day in the Life of a Financial Analyst.” Three recent alumni, Jai Krishnan, MS’16; Peter Bellino, MS’15; and Monty Hsu, MS’15; formed the panel and talked about their professional lives as financial analysts, their insights on market trends and skill sets required for finance professionals. Students interacted with the alumni during a Q&A session and said in comments, such as the following, that they found the event very beneficial and valuable:\\n“Great opportunities to meet the ones who have experienced the same situations and problems like us (students, international students, etc.).”\\n“Alumni shared their experience about job searching and how to prepare ourselves for it — learnt a lot.”\\n“Alumni gave many interview tips. They are very friendly and willing to share their experience.”\\nFinancial Engineering and Risk Management (FERM) Program\\nThe year-old MS in Financial Engineering and Risk Management program is a 36 semester-credit-hour STEM and cohort degree program that focuses on finance, programming and risk management. The program regularly holds Friday events. One recent event was a panel discussion on “A Career in Risk Management,” hosted by Edgewood Partners Insurance Center Inc. (EPIC). Panelists discussed employment opportunities, shared industry insights and trends, and collected students’ résumés. The students said they enjoyed chatting with the guest speakers and establishing mentor relationships with them. EPIC posted the event on its LinkedIn page and tagged JSOM and UTD.\\nTheGraduate Finance Management Council(GFMC), a graduate-level finance student organization, focuses on the needs and interests of graduate finance students and helps promote the MS in Finance program domestically and internationally. Recently, GFMC and Wiley cohosted a CFA Exam Prep workshop that provided students useful CFA exam preparation information and tips.\\nTheGFMC member applicationfor each academic year will be available in early December and April. All continuing students are encouraged to join GFMC and facilitate the connections between prospective and current students and alumni.\\nChun-Pin (Monty) Hsu is a senior financial analyst who specializes in business valuation. He graduated in 2012 with a bachelor’s degree in accounting from National Taiwan University. In 2015, he attained his Master of Science in Finance degree from The University of Texas at Dallas. During his time at UT Dallas, he completed all CPA exams, the CFA level I exam and internship programs with Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation, Southwest Airlines and Mercer Capital. He is now a CPA licensed in Texas and holds the CFA designation awarded by the CFA Institute.\\nHe attributes his internship opportunities, certifications and career success to his MS in Finance studies at UT Dallas:\\n“The MSF Program at UT Dallas provides students with flexible curriculum to pursue our personal goals. I was able to leverage this advantage to complete multiple certificate exams, internships and a master’s degree within two years.”\\n“My recommendation to students is to ask as many questions as possible during their time at UT Dallas. It sounds simple, but many missed this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Professors, guest speakers, alumni and classmates are always the best source of knowledge and information. With the environment provided by UT Dallas, you get to know and learn from one of the best and most diversified talent pools in the U.S., and it’s growing.”\\nWe had a successfulUT Dallas High School Top Trader Competitionin summer 2018! A total of 138 participants entered this year, 26 percent of them female and 74 percent male. This represents growth of 86 percent over the summer 2017 enrollment of 74 participants and more than double the number of participants in the summer 2016 competition (approximately 50 participants). Both Top Trader manager Kristin Spain and Dr. Carolyn Reichert, MS in Finance program director, commended student assistant and GFMC PresidentSebastian Cadariofor doing an excellent job to help with this achievement.\\nFirst-prize winner of the summer 2018 competition:\\n“The Top Trader Competition was a really great way for me to spend the summer, and I’m glad to have signed up after coming across it serendipitously. Although the actual stock trading was undeniably the more ‘exciting’ part to the competition, I appreciated the lessons on personal finance, which I believe are more applicable in my life. I learned about a broad range of topics from the business videos — from 401k plans to the 72 rule. Additionally, the online site where I traded provided an excellent way in which I could learn how to invest while foregoing all the risk associated with putting my own money in the market. My experience in this competition was commendatory, and I hope to participate again next summer.”\\n—Audrey DeJong, Richardson (Texas) High School\\nAudrey DeJong\\nSecond-prize winner of the summer 2018 competition:\\n“I learned many new concepts of finance during the competition, and not just about the stock market. I learned about personal finance and many important things later in life, like buying versus leasing a car. One of my biggest concerns while trading was the amount of stock I should buy, as I was unsure how much I was willing to risk in one company. During the competition, I decided to invest in both technology and vehicular companies. Technology companies had profits, but the vehicular companies all had losses. Luckily, I invested a substantial amount more in my technology companies than vehicular ones, so I profited. Overall, I learned that not all stocks are profitable, and you may still have many losses with a net gain.”\\n—Justin Li, Highland Park High School (Dallas, Texas)\\nJustin Li\\nPlease check theComet Calendarand theMS in Financeweb page for upcoming events.\\nView all posts by Jindal School']},\n",

Bass Frontiers of Research in Marketing Science (FORMS) Conference offered analysis into an array of topics related to marketing researchAcademic researchers in the field of marketing from around the world gathered recently at a hotel nearThe University of Texas at Dallasfor the 18th AnnualFrank M. Bass Frontiers of Research in Marketing Science (FORMS) Conference.\\nPresented Feb. 23-24 by theNaveen Jindal School of Management, the event offered analysis into an array of topics — from video games to AI to retail — providing a high-level arena for discussion as well as presentation. Attendees came from 59 universities in 9 countries, including India and China.\\nDr. Sanjay Jain, O.P. Jindal Distinguished Chair and professor in the Jindal School’sMarketing Areaand co-chair of the conference, was excited about where the conference is headed in multiple ways.\\n“The conference has grown much bigger over the years,” he said. “There were more than 130 submissions and people who come here form a high-quality group in terms of knowledge.”\\nThe conference is named for the lateDr. Frank Bass, Eugene McDermott Professor of Management at the Jindal School who was often called The Father of Marketing Science, along with being the inventor of the hallmark Bass Diffusion Model, a mathematical framework used to predict the adoption and spread of new products or innovations within a population by considering both innovation adopters and imitators over time.\\nRange of Marketing Topics\\nMushegh HarutyunyanConference participants explored a wide range of topics that capture the dynamic landscape of consumer behavior, industry strategies, and emerging trends in marketing.\\xa0For the session “Pricing and Design of Pay-to-Win Add-Ons,” Dr. Mushegh Harutyunyan, assistant professor of marketing at Imperial College London, delved into a subject which has had many a gamer, let alone a marketer, talking.\\nMany video games are free but the decision to buy add-ons can often be the difference between winning and losing, as it can be with paid games.\\n“If a developer is selling a pay-to-win add-on, the cost may be alienating players so you need to think about how they are going to compensate these players in some way to keep them on the platform — this can be moves such as decreasing the price, increasing the base product quality and reducing the power of the pay-to-win add-on,” Harutyunyan said after the talk. “All of this can help. Under conditions where you want to introduce a pay-to-win add-on, you want to think about how you design the game to balance winning and losing. With framing, you can manipulate how sensitive players become to losing versus winning. We show that you want to make them very sensitive to winning.”\\nHarutyunyan said even though gaming companies do not want that same response to losing, they do not want to make them insensitive, either.\\n“You just want to the find right balance,” he said. “You also look at cosmetic features vs. competitive features. Cosmetic doesn’t affect competitive outcomes, so they don’t give any advantage, but you find when you combine the two things when you sell the pay-to-win item becomes much more profitable so there is a kind of synergy.”\\nFor the session “Retail Media and Manufacturer Response,” Dr. Jason Choi, assistant professor at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, shared in a slide that retail media will affect manufacturer channel strategies through prisoner’s dilemma, which will result in manufacturers selling directly.\\nChoi underscored a key takeaway from his presentation — while there is a great deal of excitement in selling ads on retailer platforms, his team’s analysis suggests maybe there can be some negative unintended effects.\\n“We’re talking especially for those who don’t have a lot of customer traffic in the first place,” he said. “Because intuitively by selling ads on your platforms that could actually make brands more averse to selling their products on the platform. It’s sort of counterintuitive because advertising should be helping them sell the products… because there is an arena for advertising competition on the retail platform — that itself could drive manufacturers away from selling on the retail platform.

Podcast\\nbyCaryn Berardi- May 3rd, 2019 -Academics,Events,Students\\nAUT Dallasteam representing the campus chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) won first place at the Texas SHRM Student Conference and Games that took place at Baylor University on April 12-13. Student chapters from 10 other universities across the state participated in the conference.\\nThe SHRM UTD chapter achieved its victory at its first appearance at this event. The four-person team advanced through three rounds of head-to-head Jeopardy-style questions before defeating the Baylor team in the final round. All the questions came from the SHRM professional certification exam, according to team captain and human resource management senior Nickole Selensky.\\n“Since it was from the certification exam, everything was highly confidential,” said Selensky, who is also the incoming president of SHRM UTD. “It was cool because we have learned these concepts from our classes, but we had never seen the certification questions; so it was rewarding to see how well we knew this information.”\\nDr. Jeff Weekley, director of theBS in Human Resource Managementprogram in theNaveen Jindal School of Management, agrees that the team’s success speaks both to the rigorous curriculum of the program that was started in fall 2017 and the students’ dedication to learning.\\n“Conferences and competitions like this allow the students to spend time interacting with students from other universities and walk away with a greater appreciation for the breadth of our HR program,” Weekley said.\\nIn addition to Selensky, the winning team included Shriya Bahri, junior, human resource management; Yen Dang, graduate student, MS in Healthcare Leadership and Management and MBA; and Emma Riley, junior, human resource management. Fifteen SHRM UTD students traveled to Waco for the conference to attend leadership workshops and support the competing team.\\n“Knowing we had all the other members cheering us on was a reminder that this wasn’t just about us, it was for SHRM UTD. We wanted to do well for them,” Selensky said.\\nAlong with the encouragement from their chapter members, Selensky credits the team’s success to the diversity of knowledge from both the classroom and various internship experiences that each member brought to the team.\\nAlayna Thomas, human resource management senior and current SHRM UTD president, said showcasing their HR knowledge was the team’s main goal for competing for the first time and there was no pressure placed on them to win.\\n“I am extremely proud of our inaugural competing team for defying the odds and bringing incredible attention to UT Dallas’s BS in Human Resource Management degree,” Thomas said.\\nIn its second year, the BS in Human Resource Management program has 86 students, including 11 graduating seniors, Weekley said. The SHRM UTD chapter has doubled its membership in the last year to more than 60 students, and Selensky looks forward to continuing to engage members through competitions like this.\\n“We are student-driven and student-led, but we take it very seriously and we want students to know we are not just about meetings, but are focused on career development and growth,” she said.\\nBS Human Resource ManagementFull-Time MBAMS Healthcare Leadership and ManagementPMBA Flex\\nView all posts by Caryn Berardi']},\n",

I’ve heard good things about the inclusion and acceptance within UT Dallas’ community and for myself, it’s something I really value.

Over the past three months, I’ve developed innovative automation solutions that have significantly improved operational efficiency and patient care. My flagship project was developing an insurance verification bot using Python and UiPath. This automation solution saves over 1000 hours annually by automatically processing patient information, validating insurance details across multiple provider portals, and updating the EMR system in real time. I implemented OCR technology for document processing, integrated various insurance provider APIs, and built robust error-handling mechanisms, achieving 99.9% accuracy. I also created an intelligent appointment booking system using Python, JavaScript, and REST APIs. This system analyzes provider availability, appointment types, and patient preferences to optimize scheduling while considering equipment availability and procedure duration. Integrating our EMR system through custom APIs ensures seamless data flow and real-time updates. Another significant achievement was developing an automated invoice generation and posting system. I created a solution using SQL and Python that handles complex medical billing codes, automatically generates invoices, and posts them to our accounting system. This reduced processing time by 80% and significantly improved accuracy. I also implemented Power BI dashboards for financial reporting and analysis. Working with Dr. Abraham and the leadership team has been transformative. Our weekly strategy sessions helped me understand how technology decisions impact patient care quality. I’ve gained practical experience with various technologies including Python, SQL, RPA (UiPath), JavaScript, REST APIs, Power BI, and healthcare-specific systems. Beyond automation, I conducted comprehensive SEO analytics using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy, combined with Google Analytics API integration. Our optimization strategies drove a 25% increase in organic traffic, making our services more accessible to potential patients. This internship taught me invaluable lessons about healthcare technology implementation, HIPAA compliance, and balancing innovation with practical healthcare needs. The experience of working directly with clinical staff, IT teams, and management has given me a holistic understanding of healthcare operations. The most rewarding aspect has been seeing how our automation solutions directly improve staff efficiency and patient experience. Dr. Abraham’s mentorship has shown me how technology can be leveraged to enhance healthcare delivery while focusing on patient care quality. This experience has reinforced my passion for healthcare technology and equipped me with practical skills at the intersection of technology, healthcare, and business operations. I’m grateful to Dr. Abraham and the Eyes Now team for this opportunity to contribute meaningfully to healthcare innovation.

Podcast\\nbyJoy Donovan- March 5th, 2024 -Academics,Students\\nTaking on challenges outside of the classroom can be daunting, yet highly rewarding.\\nSelect students in theNaveen Jindal School of Managementwho had worked for months to solve a real-world business problem had a special audience for the presentation of their recommendations in February.\\nThe team of fourgraduate supply-chain managementstudents, all dressed in their most professional attire, readied their final report on the very real challenges faced byESAB, a Texas-based company that manufactures industrial welding and cutting products with a worldwide client base. Since July 2023, the foursome had analyzed the time taken by ESAB to resolve product warranty claims.\\nThe students’ audience was comprised of executives from ESAB, their professor, students from JSOM, and members of the American Society of Quality. After an introduction from Kennedy Bruce, Chair for the Dallas Section of the American Society for Quality, all were eager to hear the results of eight months of work. The students all hoped their efforts would result in earning aGreen Belt Certificatein JSOM’s Lean Six Sigma Program.\\xa0 Lean Six Sigma is a framework for improving quality, efficiency, and effectiveness.\\nWorking on such projects towards obtaining a Green Belt Certificate is not part of a course, but a separate undertaking offered to select students. A project such as this is a great résumé builder for UTD students, according toDr. Kannan Ramanathan, a clinical professor in theOperations Management Areaat the Jindal School.\\n“The real project carries a lot of weight with employers,” Ramanathan said. “In the last 15 years, I have never had a student say it was a waste of time or money. For international students it is a big plus as they do not need to have a visa or a work permit to work on an academic project.”\\nThe Green Belt candidates applied and then were selected for this special project. Ramanathan coached them throughout their endeavors.\\nMembers of the special projects team are graduate students Anusha Kalakota (Team Leader), Phani Bhushan Sankula, Abhinava Kanumuru and Supreeth Nimmagadda. ESAB executives took a special interest in the project and included Keith Barker global quality manager, Lee Chong, plant manager Purushi Doddanna, and Varsha Suman Ramanathan, the automation operations manager in the welding and cutting products division.\\xa0 Varsha, MBA’12 graduate, is the professor’s spouse and is currently pursuing a doctorate in business administration at the Jindal School.\\n“What we’re trying to do is give them a sense of what the real world is,” Doddanna said of the collaboration between UTD and ESAB.\\xa0“We want to give them the exposure. Giving them that exposure helps them to jump to the next level.”\\nKalakota points to the Albert Einstein quote “Learning is experience. Everything else is just information.” She thinks the quote aptly describes her experience on this project.\\n“I believe in this,” she said. “While classrooms provide us with rich information, true understanding and growth come from applying that knowledge in real-world projects. Through our recent project, I experienced the joy of practical application and gained invaluable insights while interacting with experts from ESAB.”\\nFor this assignment with ESAB, the students were to address customers experiencing issues with defective products who presented a warranty claim to ESAB. They were directed to find solutions to reduce the average number of days to process the claims. The current average is more than 300 days.\\nIn their February presentation of their findings, the students used charts, graphs, and maps to illustrate their work and their recommendations. The goal was to shrink the evaluation timeline from its current 86-day average to a preferred 30-day average.\\nThe students concluded the process could be improved. Their presentation pinpointed problem areas which included improving the intake process, minimizing lost data, choosing the most suitable shipping mode, and mandating detailed descriptions of product failures.']},\n",

The awards will be presented February 12 at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Dallas.\\nDallas Business Journal\\nShetty is president and chief financial officer ofSG Blocks Inc., which designs innovative container-based structures. Founded in 2007, the company uses code-engineered cargo shipping containers to construct and provide safe, strong and green structures.\\nShetty also serves on the board of directors of the company and led the company’s initial public offering in June 2017. He also serves on the board of EZlytix LLC, a private, cloud-based business-intelligence software company.\\n“My career has been a blend of the things I enjoy, real estate, technology and manufacturing,” said Shetty, who is a certified public accountant, certified IT professional and chartered global management accountant. “In my role at SG Blocks, I am able to combine all of those things.”\\nHe is proud of the fact that the company is diverse and sees that as a strength. “That will continue to grow as we grow,” he said, “and we are working to add more women and minorities at the board level.”\\nShetty, who has served on JSOM’s executive education advisory council and the graduate accounting advisory board, describes the growth and changes at JSOM since his time as a student there as incredible. “One reason I chose the school was because the professors were all so approachable,” he said. “I had a finance background, but not so much in things like marketing and organizational behavior. I needed to re-program my brain, and attending UT Dallas helped me develop a wider network and gain a broader perspective.”\\n“Mahesh has been an involved alum,” said Dr. Diane McNulty, JSOM’s associate dean for external affairs and corporate development. “He was active in the campus‘Realize the Vision’ campaignto raise $200 million.

Also among this year’s honorees are Ana Rodriguez, former director of development and alumni relations at JSOM, and currently director of the Latino Leadership Initiative at SMU Cox School of Business; and Dr. Alicia Makaye, who received her PhD in public affairs from at UT Dallas, and is co-founder of GXA Network Solutions.\\nExecutive MBA\\nView all posts by Glenda Vosburgh']},\n",

              "  'chunks': ['Providers and Suppliers: Information Sharing Is Key to Establishing Trust\\nAlumni Spotlights\\nTestimonials\\nNewsletters\\nG.O.A.T. Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- March 7th, 2017 -Faculty/Research\\nIn many marketplaces, customers rely on their service providers or suppliers to help them make purchase decisions. But whenever there is potential for a conflict of interest, the best way for a supplier to earn trust from a customer who needs help is to share information rather than offer advice or accept delegated authority.\\nNew research by a team at theNaveen Jindal School of Managementsuggests that this more hands-off approach by suppliers and service providers builds the most trusting and trustworthy relationships. The paper, “Information Sharing, Advice Provision, or Delegation: What Leads to Higher Trust and Trustworthiness?” was written by Jindal School faculty members Dr. Özalp Özer,Dr. Upender Subramanianand Dr. Yu Wang, who has since joined the faculty at California State University Long Beach. The article recently was published online in the scholarly journalManagement Science.\\nManagement Science\\n“Advice is telling them the action that should be performed, while accepting delegation is performing it for them,” said Özer, an Ashbel Smith Professor in the Jindal School’s Operations Management Area. “If you want to build a trusting relationship, don’t advise and don’t accept delegation. Instead, provide the information — tell them what you know.”\\nIf, for example, Kroger were to ask Proctor & Gamble — which has intimate knowledge of its own products — for assistance on deciding how much shelf space to devote to the P&G products Kroger distributes, then P&G could take one of three approaches.\\n“The way we design processes in business may have an impact on trust and trustworthiness,” Özer said. “Even though we are only thinking in monetary terms, the processes that we put in place may have an impact on whether or not we are going to build trust.”\\nThe first, and least effective, way to build trust with Kroger would be to accept Kroger’s delegation of the assignment to decide how much space to allocate. Any limits Kroger set would often be seen by P&G — or any supplier who had the delegated authority — as permission to do what it pleased as long as it didn’t surpass that limit, according to Özer — even if the ideal allocation might be lower than the limit that Kroger had set. Furthermore, Kroger would anticipate the supplier seeing those limits as permission, and therefore would often set those limits too tightly in the first place.\\nA second, more effective but still not ideal, way to build trust would be for P&G to advise Kroger on the amount of shelf space to devote to displaying P&G products. P&G has a fiduciary incentive to tell Kroger to use more display space than is needed.\\nThe third, best, way for P&G to build trust, according to the findings of Özer and his research team, is simply to provide Kroger with market information and let Kroger make its own decision about how much space to allocate for P&G’s products based on that information.\\nThis research can be extrapolated, Özer said, to any relationship between an expert and a person or entity seeking the expert’s opinion.\\n“The majority of the time, that relationship is such that the expert often has an incentive to manipulate his or her opinion to gain personal advantage,” Özer said. “But, even in those contexts, we still seek the opinion of the expert because we need assistance despite that conflict.”\\nThe key to look for while deciding the best approach to take, Özer said, is whether there is a conflict of interest. If there is one, then the best approach is simply to ask for information, not advice or delegation.\\nMS Management ScienceOperations Management\\nView all posts by Jimmie Markham\\nMore from Faculty/Research - News Category\\nProfessor Milind Dawande Remembered at Jindal School Event\\nJindal School Ranks No. 6 Worldwide in FT Research Productivity Rankings\\n2025 UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings™\\nAdvancing Marketing Science: Key Discussions from the Jindal School’s 2025 Bass FORMS Conference\\nResearcher Honors His Father Though His Healthcare Work\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Marketing major Tyra Banks won first place in the speed-sell contest, with fellow marketing student Vivanh (Olivia) Keomoungkhoun earning third place. Jordan Murphy, an emerging media and communication major with a minor in marketing, placed second in the role-play competition. All three students graduated in May.\\n“This was a great inaugural international experience for our sales program,” saidDr. Howard Dover, director of theCenter for Professional Sales. “We wanted to add an additional element to our program by joining our friends in Europe and learning about sales in other countries.”\\nAs she competed and attended workshops, Banks enjoyed the opportunity to meet people from around the world and to observe differences between American and European sales. She noticed that Europeans took a more conservative approach to sales, where Americans were more assertive in their efforts. She also felt the UT Dallas sales program was more current in its teachings ─ helping her to rise above the competition.\\nUsing her learned approach, Banks faced about 40 other competitors in the speed sell, where she rotated every two minutes to a new judge and communicated her marketability. She said that while she promoted her involvement at UT Dallas ─ Banks was a member of the women’s basketball team, a teaching assistant and managed corporate sponsors as a student account manager for the Center for Professional Sales ─ it was more than just listing roles.\\n“The judges told me it was wasn’t just articulating my accomplishments. It was that I showed I genuinely cared about what I was doing,” Banks said. “The repetition of learning in my advanced sales class about how to talk to people and getting comfortable with the uncomfortable really helped me.”\\nMurphy also credited the focus on preparation and practice in the Pro Sales program for his strong finish in the role-play competition, losing by just one point to a graduate student from Germany.\\n“We have a funny phrase that we coined called ‘We’re going to UTD it.’ That means that we’re going to do so much preparation and think about the magnitude of a problem and a solution to their full extents,” Murphy said. “It’s incredible to go into a competitive environment knowing that you’re prepared for whatever they may throw at you.”\\nBanks, Murphy and Keomoungkhoun are taking this preparation with them as they head into sales programs after graduation. Banks is moving to San Francisco to work for Adobe. She was invited to interview for the position based on her performance at a sales competition in Wisconsin last fall. Murphy accepted a position at Qualtrics in its Software Sales Development Program. Keomoungkhoun accepted a sales role at Fujitsu in Dallas.\\n“I have been playing basketball my whole life, and most student-athletes struggle with what comes next,” Banks said. “Sales has been my bridge to what else is out there and has helped me to move forward and get the job I have today.”\\nBS Marketing\\nView all posts by Caryn Berardi\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

The three-day event, held Jan. 30-Feb. 1, featured presentations, panels, and discussions designed to steer attendees into the future of business analytics.\\nAttendees came from across the United States and as far away as South Korea and Istanbul, Turkey.\\n“Given the fast pace of advances in technology, it is important for the academic community to get together to discuss the challenges and opportunities it brings,” saidDr. Varghese Jacob, Lars Magnus Chair and vice dean at the Jindal School. “Conferences like ASBA are therefore crucial for the exchange of ideas and solutions to ensure our programs are designed to educate our students to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities presented.”\\nCo-chairs were the Jindal School’sDr. Gaurav Shekhar, senior assistant dean of graduate programs and graduate student experience;Dr. Vatsal Maru, an assistant professor of instruction in theInformation Systems Area;Dr. Prajakti Akarte, an assistant professor of instruction in the IS Area and director of theBS Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (STEM)program and; Sunela Thomas, director of theMaster’s in Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Flex program;and Mandar Samant, MBA’21, an associate professor of practice in the IS Area.\\nThe conference program commenced with a presentation from keynote speaker Sridhar Sharma, executive vice president and chief innovation and digital officer for mortgage firm Mr. Cooper. His presentation was on the company’s digital-first strategy, which Sharma leads. It is focused on developing and implementing AI and machine-learning solutions.\\n“We are hyper-focused on efficiencies,” he said, adding that while the company has grown, it has not increased its headcount by much. “We are invested in the right set of technologies.”\\nSharma pointed to some recent innovations that the company has made involving monitoring customer/agent interactions, including how the best ranked agents are identified. He said the company had been generating significant numbers of reports every day. Now they are able to rely on an internal platform that identifies specific areas of improvement and quickly conduct any necessary training in a focused manner.\\n”Two years ago, we would have taken those employees into a training session,” he said.\\nHe also discussed the things Mr. Cooper looks for when interviewing job applicants.\\n“Two qualities we look for are math skills and knowing how the company makes money,” he said. “So many applicants cannot answer that question when asked.”\\nSharma looks for inspiration as it relates to innovation everywhere in his daily life.\\n“I wanted to attend this conference, selfishly, to learn,” he said. “Every question I receive is a learning process for me.”\\nEven driving in traffic has provided inspiration. When he saw that the Tesla he drives was able to recognize a traffic cone in the road, he took one of the company’s engineers for a ride to show him.']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- October 26th, 2017 -Academics,Events,Students\\nTiming, whether in planting a garden or planning a marketing campaign, is critical. Last spring, students from theNaveen Jindal School of Managementlearned that lesson well when they entered an international competition to create a paid search advertising campaign using Google AdWords.\\nBrittany Winters, who earned her BS in Marketing degree in June, andmarketingseniors Brooke Parker and Alexandra Lazo ran an online marketing campaign for theNational Gardening Associationin the 2017Google Online Marketing Challengeand learned this fall that they placed third in the Americas and second in the U.S. out of 825 teams.\\nGoogle allotted each team a $250 AdWords budget to develop and run a campaign for three weeks. Students were judged by how effectively they selected keywords related their organization’s needs. The goal was to achieve strong click-thru rates (CTRs) for searches and displays — key measures of ad relevance — while staying within budget.\\nThe students created a pre-campaign report that explained what their general plan would be during the competition. They did research using Google Analytics and other tools and then deployed the campaign on Google AdWords. It ran between March 31 and April 22. They measured click-thru rates, impressions, clicks and views, and conversion rates — data that showed that someone not only saw the ad but interacted with the gardening association because of it. The students took turns continuously monitoring the campaign for a total of 212 hours.\\n“It was a lot of good, practical, hands-on experience,” Winters said. “It really gave us an insight into what programs we will actually get to use in our marketing careers.”\\nThe competition took place at a time when many gardeners go online to do research related to their spring planting projects, part of the reason the students had chosen to run the ad campaign for the NGA, an organization that helps home gardeners succeed. The students knew that keyword searches related to this hobby would be plentiful.\\n“We had to sift through thousands of keywords while under pressure and make sure they were the right ones that were targeting the right audience,” Parker said. “That was really critical.”\\nPart of the challenge was to pause keywords were racking up impressions — individual views of the ad on a search result page or other site — too quickly, thus eating into the campaign’s budget. They make on-the-fly adjustments with new keywords that were more affordable but still helpful.\\nThe team members were able to handle that pressure well, part of the reason they were recruited for the competition byAlex Edsel, director of theMS in Marketingprogram at the Jindal School.\\n“This year we had an exceptional team,” Edsel said. “They had a 15 percent search click-thru rate, which was almost four times higher than the first-place team this year and better than any of the winning teams in their region during the past six years.” Despite the JSOM’s team high CTR, other contest factors contributed to the first-place team’s finish.\\nStudents from hisDigital and Internet Marketing (MKT 4330)class have participated the past five years. While the competition is worldwide with more than 1,700 teams, his teams participate in the Americas region, in which 934 teams competed this year. The United States is the most competitive country in this region with 825 teams and the most expensive and competitive Adwords auctions.\\nWinters, Parker and Lazo’s third-place in the Americas and second in the U.S. finish are consistent with past JSOM results. Teams from the Jindal School have placed in the top five percent every year they have entered the competition. During the past three years, JSOM teams have been in the finalist group and in the top five teams. Last year, a Jindal team placed second in the Americas and second in the United States.\\nMS Marketing\\nView all posts by Jimmie Markham']},\n",

She started pursuing a graduate degree in Management Science at The University of Texas at Dallas in 1977 during the School of Management’s infancy. Since this was well before it had its own building or even most of its degree offerings, she has a longer perspective than most alumni.\\n“I was very nervous on the first day of classes,” she said. “I had been challenged by friends to pursue my master’s degree; I did not know anyone.”\\nShe remembered on the day before she took her first exam, classmates were talking to one other. They were discussing theories about organizational behavior that she had never heard of. She had read the book and had taken notes during classes and the theories she was hearing from her classmates were vastly different from what she had studied.\\n“When I went in to take the test, I wondered — do I go with what I had been hearing or do I stick to what I think the answers are?” she said. “I stuck with my gut and I was the only one who made a 100 on that test. And it was a big class.”\\nMcNulty said she has stuck to her gut ever since and that doing so has played a big part in her success. She went on to earn a PhD in Business Policy and Strategy at the Jindal School in 1985 and joined the faculty in 1987. She became an assistant dean in 1991 and for the past 28 years has been associate dean for external affairs and corporate development.\\nSameer Ranjan, MS’20, was in attendance. He said he wanted to see his classmates and professors again.\\n“As I enter this campus, it always makes me feel like a student again,” he said. “As I leave campus, I always feel like ‘Oh! What am I missing again?”\\nRanjan has stayed busy since graduating from the Jindal School with a master’s degree in business analytics, having founded a company calledCatenatewhich uses artificial intelligence and data to help students and professionals discover their aptitudes, skills and knowledge gaps to help advance their careers. He was awarded a patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a computer program used in a platform offered by the company. He is also in the process of launching other companies that use AI to make the world a better place.\\nHis advice to incoming students is for them to trust their instincts because things will work out.\\n“There are good people here who will help you out,” he said. “Whenever you are down, there will be someone who will pick you up here.”\\nFor Manali Pandya, BS’13, the event was an opportunity for a very specific reunion with her favorite UTD professor, Dr. Monica Powell, who is now senior associate dean and graduate dean. Pandya had taken a required freshman rhetoric class with Powell that has proven to be unforgettable. When Pandya was asked what she remembered most from the class was Powell’s “amazing energy.”\\n“It’s more-so after the class,” she said. “She was the one professor I stayed connected to the entirety of my four years and also afterwards. I still think about the impression that she left on me. Someone asked me why I’m here today and I said, ‘I’m here to see Monica.’”\\nOne alumnus in attendance has maintained close connections with UT Dallas and the community ever since he graduated in 1985 with a double major in accounting and finance. Sunil Maini is a CPA who foundedSunil Maini CPA PC. He is also chairman emeritus of the U.S.-India Chamber of Commerce and board member of the UT Dallas International Center.\\n“Who I have become is because UTD was there,” he said. “I’ve tried to bring in interns from UTD every so often.”\\nNalin Patel, EMBA’02, is a transformational leader for global services at Nokia. He said he attended because he had heard Pirkul was going to make a big announcement and that got his attention. He also said that it had been a while since he was on campus so he thought maybe some of his classmates might be there.\\n“There are a lot of changes I see around here,” he said. “There’s a lot of construction, a lot of greenery I see around here so that’s pretty good. And I think the business school itself is great.”\\nHe visits the campus every couple of years. An engineer by trade with a bachelor’s degree in engineering and a master’s degree in computer science and electrical engineering, he worked for 20 years afterward on the management side.\\n“This executive MBA brought some new things in my life,” he said. “I learned how to manage people correctly, psychological thinking.

Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- November 7th, 2018 -Corporate,Events,Faculty/Research\\nPanelists at a recent seminar hosted by theNaveen Jindal School of Managementtook on the challenging topic of how to rein in spiraling healthcare costs. The solution? Turn the industry on its head.\\nDr. Britt Berrett, director of theCenter for Healthcare Leadership and Management, moderated the seminar, held in the Davidson Auditorium Oct. 24. More than 110 students, staff, faculty and healthcare professionals attended the presentation, “Can Payment Reform Control Rising Healthcare Costs?”\\nDr. Forney Fleming, director of the MS in Healthcare Leadership and Management program at the Jindal School, framed the discussion by providing the audience an overview of healthcare system finances. His analysis revealed a stark trend in the U.S. healthcare industry of continuously rising costs over the past five decades with a simultaneous decline in quality.\\n“It is not a sustainable situation,” he said. “… [P]oor care coordination, an aging American population, regulatory complexity and monopolistic pricing power of providers” are some of the major factors contributing to it.\\nNext up was Dr. John McCracken, director of theAlliance for Physician Leadershipat the Jindal School, who guided the audience through an explanation of the difficulties in reforming healthcare payment models. The medical service delivery model, he said, is currently in transition from a fee-for-service model to one that is more team-based. In the team-based model, hospitals, physicians and post-discharge services such as home-care providers coordinate patient care and divide the payments. The main idea behind this model is that better coordination across the continuum of care will result in much lower costs for consumers.\\nWhat is preventing a smooth transition, McCracken said, is a resistance to change on the part of physicians and hospitals due to a perception that their autonomy and position at the top of the healthcare hierarchy will be eroded. Not only that, but they will necessarily become more accountable for patient outcomes and have to take on a higher level of financial risk.\\n“These are the big obstacles to payment reform, and this is where the pushback is coming from,” he said.\\nDon Taylor, director ofSouthwestern Health Resourcesintegration atUT Southwestern Medical Center, pointed to some new concepts and models that could offer a way out of the challenges that Fleming and McCracken described. At the top of his list were clinical integrated networks and accountable care organizations. These could turn the healthcare industry on its head by changing the focus from volume-based payments that encourage greater consumption — and spending — to collaborative, patient-centered, value-based care in which improving quality while reducing costs is the focus.\\n“Are CINs the answer?” Taylor asked. “I don’t think they’re the final model, but I do believe they’re a great step toward that.”\\nDavid Link (MBA’07, MA’09, MS’12), human resources manager forRegal Research and Manufacturing Co., attended the seminar and found it to be of “extreme value” for healthcare professionals looking for context related to healthcare’s past, present and future.\\n“Not only did it provide the trends that leaders in healthcare can most certainly benefit from knowing, it provided business leaders with the tools to better plan for future healthcare cost impact by having a clear understanding of the challenges and trends,” he said. “Don Taylor’s input was of particular interest, giving great insight into what innovations are being planned and implemented right now by forward-thinking healthcare organizations.”\\nAudio from the seminar will be available in a series of upcoming episodes ofThe Business of Healthcare Podcast. In it, the panelists will answer some of the questions audience members posed.\\nThe Business of Healthcare Podcast\\nBS Healthcare ManagementMS Healthcare Leadership and Management\\nView all posts by Jimmie Markham\\nMore from Corporate - News Category\\nNew Jindal School Lab Harnesses the Power of AI\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nThanks(for)giving Reception Celebrates Jindal School’s Donors\\nJindal School's Tina T.

The theme — “Technical Fusion —Artificial Intelligencein Action” — centered on both challenges and opportunities for AI to improve society.\\nPirkul, as a longtime expert in the field, told the audience of industry and academic leaders that AI is not as new as many assume. He first began studying AI in the late 1970s.\\n“It was overhyped and forgotten about,” he said with a sense of amusement. “We now have everything in place to deploy the power of AI. This time around it is not hype. It is here to stay and impacting everything we do.”\\nJust how pervasive AI is was underscored by the other panelists who spoke in the session. Joining Pirkul were Jose Alvarez, global head of market areas, intelligent automation, AI-Transformation for Ericsson; Panna Sharma, president, CEO and board member for Lantern Pharma, and Samuel Wong, vice president and general manager of battery management solutions for Texas Instruments, Inc. Pooya Forghani, vice president of Diodes Inc., hosted the forum.Gaurav Shekhar, assistant dean for graduate programs at the Jindal School, moderated the discussion.\\nAll the panelists sent the clear message that AI’s power can work toward good for the world’s benefit in massive ways and in diverse industries.\\nWong predicted that between now and 2035, AI will improve vehicles safer and more efficient.\\n“We have the unique opportunity to put the intelligence into the car to make the car safer and cheaper,” he said. “We want to make the car smarter.”\\nIn the pharmaceutical world, AI already is improving medical treatments, according to Sharma. New therapies are being developed at increasingly rapid rates, which is especially beneficial in an aging population fighting cancer, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, he said.\\n“Being able to come up with drugs that work there is going to be very important,” he said.\\nAlvarez said he understood the fear of the unknown that grips many today since AI’s dynamic effects are still not fully known.\\n“We don’t know the power of it yet,” he said, predicting that the outcome is sure to be fascinating. “Stay in your seats, buy your tickets, get your popcorn. We don’t know what’s yet to come.”\\nThe afternoon session was a highlight of the convention convened by CIE/USA-DFW, a local nonprofit. Founded in 1989, the organization promotes community interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The national organization dates to 1917 and historically was dedicated to Chinese engineers in America, with its original name being The Chinese Institute of Engineers.']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyRachel Stowe Master- November 9th, 2017 -Academics,Events,Students\\nWhenStephen Molinatook the reins of the new Energy and Sustainability (ENGY 6v99) course, he told Jindal School Dean Hasan Pirkul he would need a bus.\\n“As smart as our student body is, sometimes feeling it, smelling it and looking at it is very useful to understanding something,” said Molina, who has been at UT Dallas since January 2016 and recently was named director of theMS in Energy Managementprogram.\\nA graduate-level course,Energy and Sustainabilitycovers major shifts in the global energy industry and the resulting impact on foreign and domestic energy policies, the environment, and corporate and government sustainability initiatives.\\n“Sustainability is the issue of the hour,” Molina said. “Sustainability goes well beyond oil and gas, coal and renewable energy. We spend quite a bit of time studying water issues and population issues and how they affect a country’s developments. We also talk about climate change. And we do quite a few field trips.”\\nSo far the class has visitedCoServ, a solar co-op in Aubrey, Texas, and the Tenaska Kiamichi power plant near Kiowa, Oklahoma. Molina chooses facilities close enough for one-day visits. The Energy and Sustainability class goes, and he invites students from other energy classes as well as members of The Energy Association UTD — until the bus is full. He hopes the other two field trips this semester include a coal-fired power plant and a nuclear power plant.\\n“You can look at a movie and read about oil and gas drilling all you want, but until you actually stand on a drill floor and see it done or see the pipe that’s being used, you don’t get it,” said Molina, who has spent 43 years as an oil and gas attorney. “And I think that’s what happened at both the solar plant and the power plant.”\\nThe CoServ tour began with a presentation from a co-op engineer, who shared schematics and explained how solar panels turn the sun’s rays into electricity. “They not only went over the process, but we also talked about the economics and the business of solar,” Molina said, noting that prior classroom discussions considered if solar and wind could survive without government tax credits and subsidies.\\nFollowing the presentation, the group toured the property. “We looked at the panels, and they explained how they’re made and what’s in them. As we walked, we spent a lot of time talking about the industry — how they feed electricity into the grid, what happens when the sun’s not out, storage issues,” Molina said.\\n“The concept of an electric cooperative power plant was new to me, and this visit got me interested in it,” said Neeraja Dharme, a second-year graduate student in the MS in Energy Management program who is in Molina’s class.\\nThe Tenaska Kiamichi visit also began with a presentation. “The power plant tour was more extensive,” Molina said. “We actually walked the whole thing. An electric power generation plant is pretty big.”\\nDharme, who came to UT Dallas from Pune in Maharashtra, India, said she was surprised to learn that a 1,220-megawatt power plant that provides electricity to more than one million homes is operated and maintained by only 35 employees. “It was very interesting to understand how these 35 employees could operate the plant so efficiently while maintaining the reliability of generation to nearly 97 percent.”\\nShe said the Energy and Sustainability course field trips add practical knowledge to the theory students learn.\\n“It is one thing to imagine how a certain power-producing unit might look and how complex the operations might be, and another to see the grandeur of these generation units, their extremely complex infrastructures, sensitivity of operations and maintenance, and of course the output they generate,” said Dharme, president of The Energy Association UTD. “These field trips provide us with the intricate knowledge bits that one can only achieve by experience. We also get to interact with the team working at these power plants and understand their roles and responsibilities, important practices and processes they follow to achieve the success of running these plants.”\\nIn addition to field trips, Molina brings in guest speakers. Bill Magness, president and CEO of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, spoke Nov. 3 to students from four Molina classes. (When news of Magness’ visit spread, other instructors asked to bring their classes.)\\n“We bring in a lot of people like that,” Molina said. “I try to mix it up. There’s a lot more to energy than just oil and gas.”\\nBringing students networking opportunities beyond the classroom, Molina also is finishing the paperwork to establish a UT Dallas student chapter of the Association of International Petroleum Negotiators.\\n“It’s for international negotiators — people who manage energy assets, which is exactly what we teach. So it’s a perfect fit,” he said. “Students will have networking, they will learn a lot about the industry, and they will meet people from all over the world.”\\nMS Energy Management\\nView all posts by Rachel Stowe Master\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.']},\n",

Students will be notified when their 75-semester credit hour review is due via UTD email. A hold will be placed on the student’s account until the student responds to the audit email and confirms the audit’s accuracy.\\nJSOM Policy: Required Courses for Degree Plan\\nStudents need to follow the major degree plan provided in their first semester for timely graduation. The student’s degree plan provides a record of all transferable college-level coursework taken from other schools of higher education (if applicable) and petitioned test scores, with the remaining requirements needed to earn their degree from UTD.\\nStudents receive two versions of the degree plan:\\nThe Four-Year Planorganizes required courses by semester to provide students with a roadmap to graduation. All courses and prerequisites must be completed successfully to graduate.\\nThe Four-Year Plan\\nThe General Degree Planorganizes courses by category, similar to the undergraduate academic catalog  (e.g.,University Core Curriculum, Major Preparatory, JSOM Core, Major/Related Core, Guided Electives and Free Electives). The general degree plan supplements the four-year plan for cross-checking purposes.\\nThe General Degree Plan\\nStudents must follow the major’s four-year plan provided by the JSOM Advising to ensure that prerequisites are met, courses are taken in the correct sequence and major courses are taken in the semester offered to ensure timely graduation.\\nRequired Courses for the First Semester at UTD\\nJSOM requires that students complete the following courses in their first semester at UTD to make suitable academic progress:\\nFirst-time-in-college Freshmen StudentsBCOM 1300 Introduction to Professionalism and Communication in Business (corequisite UNIV 1010)UNIV 1010 Freshman Seminar (corequisite BCOM 1300)MATH 1325 Applied Calculus I or other Calculus I course\\nBCOM 1300 Introduction to Professionalism and Communication in Business (corequisite UNIV 1010)\\nUNIV 1010 Freshman Seminar (corequisite BCOM 1300)\\nMATH 1325 Applied Calculus I or other Calculus I course\\nTransfer StudentsBCOM 3300 Professionalism and Communication in BusinessMATH 1325 Applied Calculus I or other Calculus I course\\nBCOM 3300 Professionalism and Communication in Business\\nPrerequisite or Corequisite\\nMost major core, major related and guided elective courses in JSOM require prerequisites or corequisites. Prerequisites or corequisites for each course can be found in thecourse descriptionin the Undergraduate Catalog. All prerequisites must be met before being registered for any subsequent JSOM courses. Corequisites can be taken concurrently with the course.\\nPrerequisites and corequisites are enforced based on the current catalog at the time of registration.\\nPrerequisites: Prerequisites are courses that must be taken before progressing to other courses. For example, MATH 1325 is a prerequisite for HMGT 3301, so MATH 1325 must be completed successfully before taking HMGT 3301.\\nCorequisite: Corequisites are courses that are taken concurrently with another course. For example, BCOM 1300 has a corequisite of UNIV 1010, so students must take both BCOM 1300 and UNIV 1010 together.\\nPrerequisite or Corequisite: A course that is a prerequisite or corequisite can be completed before or taken with another course. For example, OPRE 3360 is a prerequisite or corequisite of FIN 3320, so OPRE 3360 must be taken before or can be taken with FIN 3320.\\nPrerequisites Off-Campus: If a prerequisite is taken off-campus, an official transcript must be submitted to UTD with a grade of “C” or better before the student can register for any course at UTD requiring that prerequisite.\\nDropping Prerequisite or Corequisite\\nIf a course is designated as a prerequisite or corequisite to another course, the student cannot drop the “prerequisite or corequisite” course without dropping the other course. For example, a student that is registered for FIN 3320 and OPRE 3360 and needs to drop OPRE 3360 must also drop FIN 3320, as OPRE 3360 must be completed before or with FIN 3320. However, the student can drop FIN 3320 and remain in OPRE 3360, as FIN 3320 is not required to be completed before or with OPRE 3360.\\nJSOM Internship Requirements\\nInternship: JSOM major students who have completed a JSOM internship (zero to 3 credit hours) satisfy graduation requirements. Earned internship credit hours cannot be used to fulfill the guided elective credit hours in the new major.\\nJSOM Senior Capstone and Community Engagement Requirements',\n",

However, students MUST provide the syllabus from the semester the course was taken (e.g., a course was taken in Fall 2021, thus the Fall 2021 syllabus must be submitted). Additionally, the syllabus must include information (e.g., prerequisites, required textbooks, a weekly course schedule) to indicate the content and rigor compared to the UTD course.\\nConcurrent Enrollment at Another Institution of Higher Education\\nStudents interested in taking courses at another school while attending UTD must have pre-approval and complete a Transfer Credit Pre-Approval Request form signed by the student and approved by the JSOM academic advisor.\\nStudents completing prerequisites at another school must send an official transcript to UTD, with final grades of C or better, before registering for any JSOM courses that require these courses as prerequisites.

              "  'chunks': ['Students in theUT Dallas AIS chapterare doing most of the conference planning and coordination. The students have been very busy organizing a detailed agenda, securing industry sponsors and booking speakers.\\n“Planning for such an incredible event has been as large and empowering as it has been enjoyable,” says Cannon Burton, director of outreach for the UT Dallas AIS Student Chapter. “The inside knowledge I have gained from industry leaders, leadership skills I have developed while guiding my peers, and the wonderful interactions with everyone involved have helped me grow as a person. Providing such a vital role in this year’s AIS SCLC is truly one of my proudest achievements.”\\nMatthew Cocco, president of UT Dallas AIS, adds that “planning an event at this scale and having the opportunity to work with industry professionals to put this together has been an informative growth experience. It’s taught me a lot about what it takes to coordinate between teams to achieve greater objectives.”\\nDr. Dawn Owens, faculty advisor to the UT Dallas AIS chapter, says that it has been exciting to see students volunteer and get involved. “Planning an event of this size and scope teaches students real-world skills,” she says. “Most importantly, they are learning the arts of negotiation, communication and coordination. I am thankful to the AIS Advisory Board for choosing UT Dallas and giving our students this opportunity.”\\nITS Academy\\nTheITS Academycontinues to bring positive attention to the ITS program and the Naveen Jindal School of Management. The ITS Academy houses various outreach initiatives that introduce middle school and high school students to the wide variety of opportunities an ITS degree can provide. The academy showcases the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) offerings at JSOM in two- to five-day programs.\\nSince the first event in 2016, academy programs have drawn 150 participants. Among those who have attended, five have subsequently enrolled at UT Dallas as BS in ITS students. Sponsorships cover 80 percent of the costs of academy programs. Parents have called the academy an excellent recruiting tool that helps them evaluate options for their children.\\nWhy do the programs work? They provide students a chance to come to campus and experience campus life. Our current BS in ITS students help with events and interact with participants. Visitors see firsthand many of the wonderful academic, social and other options that UT Dallas has to offer, and they can see themselves as college students. Many students leave feeling excited — rather than intimidated — about college life.\\nThree ITS Academy events coming up include our first-ever hackathon,Hack IT, where students will learn about the “internet of things.” The hackathon will be followed by ourG.I.R.L.S. STEM Symposiumand our third-annualITS Exploration Camp. To learn more about these events, visit theITS Academywebpage.\\nThe BS in ITS program continues to be a strong undergraduate program in the Jindal School. In the past two years, the program has grown from 400 students in fall 2015 to 650 in fall 2017, an increase of 63 percent.\\nThe program has experienced several positive trends, including an increase in freshman applications. In the past two years, the size of the incoming freshman class has nearly doubled, going from 35 to 67 in fall 2017. In fall 2018, we anticipate our largest freshman class yet, close to 100 students. We attribute this growth to the STEM designation and to our technically rigorous program.\\nAnother growth trend is in the percentage of female students in the program. The 2017 school year not only was significant for JSOM in terms of enrollment, but also was in line with national goals to increase the number of women with STEM educations. In fall 2017, female students accounted for 30 percent of the BS in ITS program’s enrollment, up from 23 percent in fall 2015.\\nWe also are ahead of the national average of 25 percent women in technical education. That gives the undergraduate ITS program one of the highest percentages in the country in terms of women in the program. These numbers are important as we continue to address the shortfall of female STEM workers. Although women comprise 57 percent of the U.S. labor force according to theU.S. Department of Labor, as of this writing, only 30 percent of them are working in the tech industry, and only 28.8 percent of STEM workers are women (Institute for Women’s Policy Research).\\nThe growth in female enrollment can be linked to events like the G.I.R.L.S. STEM Symposium and ourWomen in Technology and Business (WITB)student organization. The ITS program is proud of empowering more and more female students with a strong degree. Companies such as Pioneer Natural Resources and PepsiCo are committed to an inclusive and diverse employee base, and they have been continual proponents and supporters of our various offerings. For example, Pioneer Natural Resources generously provided a sponsorship to our WITB student organization, and PepsiCo has been working with us on our G.I.R.L.S. STEM Symposium to target underrepresented groups.\\nPartnering with diversity-focused companies introduces female students in JSOM to the evolving world of IT and shows them how more women are reaching new heights in IT careers. These partnerships are a true representation of core school and University values that revolve around creation of opportunities and inclusivity. These partnerships reflect the strong/unstinting support that JSOM Dean Hasan Pirkul provides to the programs and events we host.

Each winner is presented with a $1,000 honorarium and a certificate at the reception.\\nMan“Manhoman’s dissertation combined advanced operations research and economics models to solve real problems,” said Dr. Vijay Mookerjee, Charles and Nancy Davidson Chair and PhD coordinator in theInformation Systems Areaat JSOM. “In one of his essays, we were able to apply the solution to solve a procurement problem faced byCidewalk, a mobile ad delivery firm operating in the Boston area.”']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyMarcos Pelaez- September 22nd, 2015 -College Knowledge,Joining JSOM\\nIt’s the first day of college, and I’m sitting in class wondering, “What now?” I’m sure every freshman starts to wonder the same thing. I remember coming to orientation and seeing all these different tables at the org fair. It seemed as if there had been a club for everything. There were intramural sports, Greek life, academic groups and even religious ones. There were groups that organized activities around campus and some that could familiarize you with other cultures. It was overwhelming. I wanted to join something. I wanted to feel like I was a part of something, hopefully making a difference along the way. All throughoutWelcome WeekI had a multitude of fliers being handed to me. I noticed various clubs and organizations hosting events. The promise of free food and T-shirts won me over, and I ventured out of my dorm to check out what was going on. I’m glad I made that decision.\\nIt seemed every club had something different to offer to different people. So, where was my niche? I just couldn’t pick. I wanted to join so many and realized I didn’t even know how to join one. I remembered the stack of fliers I had tucked away at the bottom of my backpack, found one I liked and contacted the email on the back. They told me it was great that I was interested and welcomed me to the school. They explained I had to make an account on orgsync. From there I could join any group I wanted. I ventured off to the first meetings of several clubs: Fencing, SUAAB, rock climbing. I met awesome people along the way. The friends I’d already made got in on the action as well. We looked at soccer, longboarding and clubs for our respective majors. I just couldn’t help but feel that I was in the wrong place.\\nI finally stopped and thought to myself, “What do I really want to do?”\\nIn high school I had played sports year round, was active in student government and theNational Technical Honor Societyand was a Peer Helper in the guidance counselor’s office. I liked being around people, but mostly I liked being able to have fun with them and, if needed, make their days better. Throughout it all, I volunteered extensively. I wanted to find something that could give me all of that. Fortunately, I found the answer the next day.\\nI was with my friend, Cannon. He had been on his own search for his place on campus and decided to rush a fraternity. He invited me to come out with him, and I was eager to check it out. Boy, was I amazed. Everything I was looking for was packaged up right in front of me. There was camaraderie, service in the community and a multitude of like-minded men who wanted to make the most of their time in college. I felt at home. The ensuing years as a brother inChi Phihave been some of the greatest of my life. I ended up getting more involved around campus, joiningStudent Governmentand the Racquetball Club. I became more involved with theAES Cultural Scholarsand joined theProfessional Program in Accounting.\\nBeing a part of something bigger motivates me to excel in everything I do. Had it not been for my involvement in the fraternity, I don’t believe I would’ve met the amazing people, nor experienced the adventures that I will cherish in my memories for years to come. I urge every student to find their passion and a club that can foster that passion. Whether it be through Greek Life, Student Ambassadors or the Volleyball Club, there is something for everyone at UTD. I feel I’ve made my mark here; it’s time for you to do the same.\\nView all posts by Marcos Pelaez\\nMore from College Knowledge - Blog Category\\nStudent Spotlight: Anthony Chu\\nAnthony Chu is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and he is expected to graduate Dec. 2026.\\nStudent Spotlight: Dena Aljabari\\nDena Aljabari is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and Analytics and she is expected to graduate May 2025.\\nStudent Spotlight: Nnamdi Edeoga\\nNnamdi Edeoga is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management and is expected to graduate in May 2025.\\n5 Reasons to Study Risk Management and Cyber Security at UT Dallas\\nAn understanding of risk management and cybersecurity can help individuals create resilient businesses that can stand the test of potential threats.\\nStudent Spotlight: Madison Hill\\nMadison Hill is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management and a Bachelor of Science in Finance double-major and she is expected to graduate May 2026.\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

I had I think 6 or 7 offers out of high school,” he said. “As soon as I came to UTD and I saw how advanced the infrastructure was, I read about how good our business school was. The school aspect of UTD alongside the family culture of the basketball team is what made me choose here over everything else.”\\nEdeoga trains daily, studies hard, and keeps up with friends on campus every week.\\n“I’ll usually wake up, and depending on what time I wake up, I’ll either go to the training room and get some treatment beforehand, or just wake up and go to class if I wake up later,” he said. “Go straight from class typically to practice and then weights. After weights, I’ll go back to my apartment, maybe take a nap, relax a little, then go to the library and get my work done. Once my work is done, relax with my friends because having a social life is extremely important to me.”\\nEdeoga makes room in his busy schedule for the things he values, including making connections with peers.\\n“I’ve always been a hard worker, both on and off the court, but being able to balance and know that your life is more than just work and having that social aspect is very important to me as well,” he said.\\nEdeoga’s initial plan upon entering school was to eventually become a doctor, but after some self-reflection following a few challenging courses, he decided to change his path.\\n“Now I’m on the business track for healthcare administration,” he said. “I’m very proud of myself for that, knowing that this wasn’t for me, but I found something that is more my niche and having the initiative to do all that can be done to be successful in that field.”\\nToday, Edeoga is thrilled to be in the fast-track program for healthcare administration.\\n“Being able to get that opportunity has been huge for me and has led to a lot of open doors,” he said. “Even this internship right now, them knowing that I’m on a master’s fast track put me on their radar.”\\nEdeoga has been thankful for the guidance of faculty likeKristin Tesmer, a professor of practice in the Jindal School’sOrganizations, Strategy and International Management Areaand director of the bachelor’s in healthcare management program. He has also appreciated support from Amye Broyles, program manager for the bachelor’s in healthcare management program, andKeith Thurgood, the director of the master’s in healthcare leadership and management program.\\nEdeoga namesDaniel Karnutaas one of his most influential professors at JSOM.\\n“I loved all his lectures,” he said. “I feel like I learned a lot and honestly it prepared me a lot for this internship because they ask me a lot of questions and ask for my opinion on things that I learned in his class. I’m very grateful for him teaching all this stuff that I know today.”\\nEdeoga emphasized the value of making connections in college.\\n“It’s important, of course, to learn,” he said. “But I would say networking and the people you meet is the most important thing you can get out of college. If you go to school and the only thing that you get out of it is just your degree, then you’re approaching it the complete wrong way.

He is currently doing a third internship at HCA Fawcett Memorial Hospital in Port Charlotte, Fla. for summer 2024.\\n“I’m interning under the CEO Michael Ehrat as an administrative intern,” he said. “I’m getting an overview of what it’s like being in an administrative role at a hospital. My duties include analyzing data, creating reports, sitting in on meetings and shadowing different hospital departments.”\\nUltimately, Edeoga hopes to step into a CEO role himself, and right now he is working hard both finishing school and building his professional experience in the field.\\nBS Healthcare ManagementInspirationStudent ExperienceStudent Organizations\\nView all posts by Jindal School\\nMore from Business School - Blog Category\\nStudent Spotlight: Anthony Chu']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyJill Glass- November 2nd, 2015 -Jindal News & Events\\nThe most common mistake taxpayers make when coming to court to protest their income tax bill is not being fully prepared, U.S. Tax Court Judge Albert G. Lauber recently told a packed auditorium of students at the Naveen Jindal School of Management.\\nLauber was in Dallas Oct. 20 hearing local tax cases and took a break from the bench to speak to some 300 students, staff and faculty in the Davidson Auditorium. Although the U.S. Tax Court is physically located in Washington, D.C., its 19 presidentially appointed judges travel nationwide to hear cases involving taxpayer disputes with the Internal Revenue Service.\\nThe majority of the cases Lauber hears, he said, are simple cases that require taxpayers to document the deductions they have claimed; however, many don’t organize their receipts and documents.\\n“If you’re a contractor and you have all these different expenses for insurance and other expenses, and you have all your invoices and receipts organized and tabulated, you’ll probably have a very strong case. In fact, the case would probably get settled with the IRS if you could do that,” he said.']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyKristine Imherr- December 4th, 2015 -Jindal News & Events\\nA team ofNaveen Jindal School of Managementstudents placed third in a recent real estate case study competition that called for them to save an ailing retail plaza in “Big City, Texas.” Their proposal included new amenities ranging from early morning exercise options to late-night salsa dancing, food trucks and a public park.\\nNikkhil LaCoul, Lawren Miller, Kenneth Messer, all senior finance majors, and James Brandt, a junior business administration major, prepared their transformation plan for presentation at the Texas Conference and Deal Making, held Nov. 4 in Dallas. The annual event and the competition are both hosted by the Texas International Council of Shopping Centers. ICSC awarded the team $2,000 and student ICSC memberships for a year.\\nTheir challenge was to revive a more than 30-year-old “shopping center that had a bunch of low-end places and was basically falling part,” Miller said.\\nBehind the scenes, the partnership that ran the complex also was disintegrating, and an $18 million construction loan was coming due. The JSOM’s team approach included having the three limited partners buy out the general partner in order to stabilize the management relationship. The group also proposed debt refinancing.\\nPart of the team’s revitalization strategy called for tearing down one section of the center occupied by decrepit storefront offices and donating a rear excess parcel of land to Big City for a park that would include permanent food truck parking.\\nBeyond that, Miller said, their ideas called for drawing in more customers earlier and keeping them later by leasing space to a fitness center that would open daily at 5 a.m. and to a Mexican food restaurant that would offer salsa dancing nightly after 10.\\n“We wanted to make it so that people could come and spend their whole day there,” Miller said.\\nDr. Randall Guttery, head of JSOM’s Real Estate Concentrations, selected the team members from students who have taken real estate classes.\\n“A tremendous amount of effort was expended by these students, including some 3 a.m. nights,” Guttery said. “Professor[George] DeCourcyand I could not be more proud of them. And the real-world exposure to hundreds of real estate professional is invaluable.”\\n“I learned a ton. I’m really grateful to have been chosen,” said Miller, who enrolled in real estate courses, in part, to learn how to manage property her family owns.\\nFrom the competition, she added, she and her teammates have learned to look at shopping centers differently. “Now we all look at the layout first and then we check the tenant mix to see if it works, in our opinion.”\\nIn all, 11 universities were asked to participate in the by-invitation-only competition. An SMU team placed first and earned $6,000 in the ICSC contest. A team from Texas Tech University placed second and took home $4,000. In fourth behind JSOM was a team from Texas Christian University that earned $1,000.\\nBusiness AdministrationBusiness CompetitionsStudent Experience\\nView all posts by Kristine Imherr']},\n",

It can be your best pal to brainstorm.”\\nAttendee Jeff Henson, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma IT project manager, appreciated that the symposium gave an arena to focus on AI.\\n“It’s important because you have to start preparing now for that,” he said. “You need to have some sort of vision to accommodate rapid growth coming. It’s important to relate to a process and repeat it. We want to see what others are doing in different forms and different ways and from different-sized companies, from profit to nonprofit. It’s important to see how everyone is adapting and overcoming to meet challenges.”\\nShannon Ivey, project manager at Vistra, was particularly impressed by the second day keynote.\\n“The best session was the one called ‘A Star is Born’ where the speaker (Kimia Penton) talked about being engaged more with stakeholders, being more involved overall and giving a real-life perspective with real-life case studies,” she said. A case study that stood out to her in the session was one when a company chose renovation as a solution.\\n“I found myself nodding my head in how the session related to our environment,” she said.\\nKhavya Ramachandran, project manager at Vistra, valued that session but keynote speaker Kandyce Ormes-Ripley, associate vice president, data analysis & strategy at Buckner International, also stood out to her.\\n“She came from a nonprofit and some of the stories were sad but it showed you learn from so many life situations relating to project management and taking into account the emotions you put into your work as you try to make a timeline,” she said.\\nBarden believes many people got more comfortable with AI through the event and can take confidence and further direction back to their positions.\\n“When I look at it, I see AI as being in the business analytics area and we’ve been a part of that area for a long time, so, in a way, there can be comfort there,” he said. “AI will be with us and you have to see there is an art to it like anything else. AI may land the plane but we will schedule where it lands, we can be the one who decides so much of the why. Make it work for you. AI isn’t the first disruptive technology — and it won’t be the last.”\\nFisher said the collaborative effort between UT Dallas, PM World Journal and PMI Dallas brought together leading minds in project management to share knowledge, foster innovation, and build lasting professional relationships.

              "   'Project Management Symposium Centers on AI\\nAlumni Spotlights\\nTestimonials\\nNewsletters\\nG.O.A.T. Podcast\\nbyEric Butterman- June 7th, 2024 -Events\\nBeing a project manager means using different kinds of skills: organization, leadership and listening. All may be needed, including an open mind, to contend with the shifting quicksand that artificial intelligence can feel like. The 16th AnnualProject Management Symposiumbrought further clarity to the relationship between the two as the winds of change and technology blow.\\nTaking place May 20-21 at theNaveen Jindal School of Management, one of the main focuses of the event was the question of whether AI is a tool which could make a project manager’s job easier or could it, as some might fear, put them out of a job? The former was clearly the dominating message, but the possibility of the latter wasn’t completely dismissed.\\nGreg Saunders, enterprise project portfolio manager for The Exchange, the military retailer, said in his talk, “Does AI or HI (Human Intelligence) Make a Better PM?” in the first-day session that there was no denying AI’s presence.\\n“IBM says 77 percent of new entrants in the workplace are going to have their work affected by it,” he stated.\\nAt the same time, he underscored what is indeed artificial and where AI can’t replace a human, especially in the area of leadership.\\n“We can protect someone’s esteem, okay?” he said. “We can protect their character and get them on the right foot again. That is something we do (that a) machine can never do…”\\nAfter the talk, he said he wanted the audience to also understand that fear needs to often be replaced by curiosity, despite showing that AI could easily beat him when it came to getting some answers.\\n“We focus on risk and people need to know that, yes, this is risk but you can still have your job with your company,” he said.\\nThe symposium, like AI, is an opportunity for the Jindal School.John Barden, dean ofExecutive Educationin the Jindal School, said the event is a valuable and informative feather in the business school’s cap in multiple ways.\\n“It introduces you in a deeper way to the value of project management,” he said. “We have classes in the business school that relate to it and we need to have project management be even more a part of our offerings. With this event, it’s an important chance for people to come together, share ideas and network. Project management means different things to different people. It’s important to know how positions in the field are evolving and the techniques to do their jobs better.”\\nBarden feels this is also a moment that can galvanize project management by coming together when AI is clearly putting many people ill at ease.\\n“AI is a hot topic as is project management and supply chain,” he said. “The symposium hits on all of these and more. This is a win-win for the university and faculty but also the community because project management is a huge part of the future of business. It’s about keeping AI going not just for 12 to 18 months as the latest popular phrase but for years to come in instruction. Some of our keynotes bring that mirroring of practical experience with theoretical and that is crucial in AI and project management.”\\nFrank Murphy, a program manager at USAA and managing member of Strategic Disruption Consulting, LLC (SDVOSB), in his day one talk, “Project Management Leadership – Does AI Change My Role?,” was quick to point out where he doesn’t want AI near a project or where it should be kept in limited scope.\\n“We always want to reduce risk,” he said. “If it’s a decision that doesn’t make much drama out of anything, no impact, or anything else, let it ride. If it’s a bigger decision, citing political stuff, anything like that, don’t do it.”\\nAfter his talk, he said AI may have helpful tools but make sure to look at what the background is and how they are working for you.\\n“Leverage your experience as opposed to giving it up automatically to a tool,” he said.\\nHe also reiterated where the buck stops when it comes to accountability when using AI technology, finding comparison to tools used by a financial analyst.\\n“I can’t blame it on Excel,” he said. “I’m still beholden to that answer whatever that answer is.”\\nLucas Smith, director of agile & program services, for Toyota Connected North America, in his talk “Navigating the AI Revolution in Project Management,” said he believes the world changed forever on Nov. 30, 2022. This was the day ChatGPT was born. Part of one of his slides declared: “A Date Which Will Live in Infamy.”\\nHe reminded the audience that companies need to be prepared for products that they are using that will be later rolling out AI tools and said after his talk that he hoped the audience would realize that “people have a better perspective on how to manage different types of efforts…not everything fits in one size, but there’s a lot of different spectrum(s) on that. Hopefully you get the tools so when you encounter the technology you know how to go about managing it.”\\nAnd he knows the fear is palpable.\\n“I think the biggest fear is how will this impact me and my job,” he said after his talk. “We know it will be impacting a lot of careers…But this is bigger than the industrial revolution and this is going to provide a lot of changes. Now change is also opportunity. If you are in the midst of it, the question is do I take advantage of the opportunity or not…? The question is can you harness it? Do you understand how?”\\nBarden moderated a roundtable discussion called “Navigating the AI Revolution in Project Management.” Panelists were Natalia Fisher, president of thePMI Dallas Chapter; Jason Andrews, a technical specialist at Microsoft; Silvia Davis,\\nAndrews talked about how best to utilize AI to drive value.']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyEric Butterman- March 19th, 2024 -Events,Faculty/Research\\nEd O’Boyle, global practice leader at Gallup, was the keynote speaker at the Jindal School’s Fourth Annual Undergraduate Deans ConferenceA recent conference presented by theNaveen Jindal School of Managementsaw representatives from 45 schools grappling with the problems and opportunities of a changing higher-education landscape, including in the area of technology.TheFourth Annual Undergraduate Deans Conferencetook place March 7-8, the first day on campus, the second day at a nearby hotel. The theme was “Innovate to Elevate.”Keynote speaker Ed O’Boyle, global practice leader at Gallup, noted that higher education has received lower marks in recent polls overall than in the past. It will clearly take time to regain trust, not an unknown problem these days, he shared, whether in the realms of government or business.“We’re seeing an erosion in our confidence in the higher education that’s happening throughout the country,” he said.Even so, it doesn’t mean the value of an education is highly doubted.“71 percent of people who are currently enrolled in bachelor degree programs say it is worth it to be in school,” he said.What could help turn around the overall assessment of higher education? Possibly preparation of incoming students.“Freshly-minted students are not ready to work,” O’Boyle said of recent poll findings, an assessment which ran the gamut from young people not knowing how to sit in meetings to the degree of professionalism they display. He also underscored the importance of helping students in job selection as workers are six times more engaged when they get to use their strengths every day.The Role of AI in Higher EducationDr. Varghese Jacob, Jindal School vice dean and Lars Magnus Ericsson Chair, moderated a panel discussion that centered on artificial intelligence titled “How AI is Changing the Landscape of Business Education.” Jose Alvarez, head of intelligent automation & AI transformation market areas at Ericsson, encouraged patience, even comparing AI to a relationship that needs to be nurtured. Joseph Bailey, associate dean of undergraduate programs at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, believes higher education cannot shy away from AI and offered an example when it came to scale, dealing with what is basically a chatbot, one that can handle course questions.“How can we provide that 24/7 access,” he asked. “How do you provide scalability to programs in student services? We’re not trying to replace people, right? We’ve got nine great academic advisors who work with students to map our their journey. But, in places like our general business minor, how can we get more scale in things like this chatbot?”Gaurav Shekhar,\\xa0senior assistant dean of graduate programs at the Jindal School facilitated an interactive discussion focused on innovative strategies for enhancing student success and engagement.Dr. Charles Keene, associate dean of the undergraduate programs at the University of Iowa’s Tippie College of Business, felt gratitude needed to grow in the programs he leads — thus, Keene’s Kudos became a part of the school’s social media strategy. Students would suggest other students who deserved to be spotlighted. Dr. Robert Whitelaw, dean, undergraduate college, at New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business, share that having students scan their IDs to check in at events has allowed NYU to better gauge student engagement.Dr. Haya Ajjan, associate dean of the Love School of Business at Elon University opened the second day of the conference with her presentation, “What Happens to Learning When Generative AI Can See, Hear, and Speak.”Ajjan mentioned programs ranging from Copilot to Beautiful.AI. When referring to the impact of AI technology, she said that leaders of companies see the future as personalized assistants. As a further example of AI power, she shared how in a course ChatGPT was put to the entrepreneurship test. From helping to find a new product idea to creating a website for it, ChatGPT, she said, was ready to assist.“There are a lot of ways in which we can adopt it and I think we have to adopt it,” she said of AI. “Our students are going to join a workplace that is going to utilize this new technology.”Microcredentials Help Narrow Students’ Experience GapMicrocredentials, as the name would suggest, are a smaller competency credits than what is usually defined as a credential but have big potential in higher education. They were the focus of another panel discussion.Dr. Poonam Kumar, associate provost for online and continuing education at the University of Texas at Tyler, named some of what fits under the microcredential umbrella, including certificates, mini-degrees, bootcamps and digital badges. The interest in microcredentials, she said, is growing as companies want to be sure that students have the skills they need.Dr. Robin Macaluso, associate professor, chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Texas at Arlington, shared that her school allows microcredentials to be taken over a longer period of time than a semester as the time commitment may be difficult. Dr. Valentina Salotti,\\xa0associate dean for academic affairs and diversity at the Ivy College of Business at Iowa State University, offered that an important value microcredentials provide is that in an age when first-year students are looking for internships but may have little relevant experience, a microcredential can be a selling point to companies.In This TogetherIn addition to the conversations centered on technology and innovation, one of the conference’s selling points was the collegial atmosphere.Dawn Owens speaking at the Fourth Annual Undergraduate Deans Conference“Part of the reason we do this conference is to build relationships with our peer schools and discuss important topics in higher ed administration, AI is one example,” saidDr. Dawn Owens, Jindal School associate dean of undergraduate programs and conference chair. “It’s on everyone’s mind and AI is just one area in which we can learn from each other. Bringing people together from our peer schools and having a conversation about how to address is very productive along with being able to talk about the issues and challenges we all face. This year we brought in different perspectives — we have the academic perspective but we also have industry perspective. Our keynote was from industry and we had an industry speaker after lunch, because at the end of the day we want to make sure students are ready for the workforce and are able to find jobs. Having these conversations together is important for creating our roadmap for the future.”Conference attendees often wear many different hats at their schools, Owens said, and the conference can help shed some light on available opportunities that might otherwise be missed.“We’re making sure we’re giving the students tools and resources by incorporating AI into the classroom,” she said. “However, AI can also be used outside the classroom for student services and advising. Some of us haven’t thought of these things as much, again, because we have so many different roles. Here we can share ideas to further elevate student success, on both the academic and academic-supporting sides.Bailey found the conference a standout.“I’m very thankful for UT Dallas for hosting this event,” he said. “I’m taking a lot back to my institution and when we had the chance to throw out the biggest challenges we’re facing it was really helpful and speaks to the collaborative environment…I spoke about technology and how we can adopt it and use it but, like a lot of things, it’s a tool. Just like with microcredentials, I want to hear the good, bad and ugly of these things. The new technologies from these sessions have me thinking about ways to experiment.”Dr. Tracey Reed, associate dean of undergraduate programs and administration in the Walker College of Business at Appalachian State University, found the session on AI to be a highlight.“Right now we are contemplating how to incorporate it into the curriculum,” she said. “You need to understand it for the marketplace. It’s my second year coming to this conference and I really enjoyed talking with people in similar positions. In the exercise of sharing problems, the first row answered that they just worked on what my problem was and they gave me great advice.”Dr. Justin Gandy, senior associate dean at the College of Business at Dallas Baptist University, was also in his second year of attending the event.“Hearing what everyone else is going through you realize we’re not so far off,” he said. “I take comfort in knowing we’re on the same page and dealing with similar issues. The microcredentials session was great. We’re beginning our journey with Coursera on microcredentials so that was just very helpful.”Dr. Jaclyn Jensen, associate dean for student success at the Driehaus College of Business at DePaul University, found the generative AI session poignant and the overall conference experience energizing.“I was able to connect some of the problems I’m working on to applications that we got to learn about today,” she said. “It sparked some excitement and creativity in my own mind in how we can start to leverage technology in a way that I think will be beneficial and value-added to our students.Dawn Owens with TemocAttendees were treated to pre-conference activities such as campus tours and a visit with UT Dallas mascot Temoc. Jensen said the conference tied together for her because participants were asking themselves who they are ultimately and who they serve.“It’s our students,” she said, “so having the time and space to think about how we’re delivering that value is very important.”AIArtificial IntelligenceView all posts by Eric Butterman\\nA recent conference presented by theNaveen Jindal School of Managementsaw representatives from 45 schools grappling with the problems and opportunities of a changing higher-education landscape, including in the area of technology.\\nTheFourth Annual Undergraduate Deans Conferencetook place March 7-8, the first day on campus, the second day at a nearby hotel.

This year, the school moved up one spot, to No. 17.\\n“We have been steadily moving up in the Financial Times rankings since we began participating,” saidDr. Hasan Pirkul, Caruth Chair and Jindal School dean. “We expect that, because we work to get better every year. But a jump of eight places in one year is very gratifying, especially when you consider all the challenges the pandemic has brought our way.”\\nMoving into the ranks of the top 40 U.S. schools is a milestone, JSOM Senior Associate Dean and Dean of Graduate Programs Monica Powell said, “and I have to point out that we also are excited by our research ranking this year.”\\nResearch Reinforced\\nThe Jindal School advanced 12 places in the research ranking, moving from the No. 17 spot last year to No. 5. That position was determined by the number of scholarly articles full-time faculty members published in 50 selected academic and practitioner journals between January 2018 and July 2020. Then the total was weighted, relative to each school’s faculty size.\\n“The research ranking validates the findings of our ownUTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings™,” Powell said. There, the Jindal School stands at No. 4, based on a database that tracks publications in 24 leading scholarly business journals.\\n“It is hard to toot your own horn about your standing when results come from your own research tool,” Powell said. “TheFinancial Timesranking independently speaks to our research strength.”\\nMethodology\\nTheFinancial Timesrankings were determined using 20 weighted categories. The research rank accounts for 10% of each school’s total score. Eight categories, accounting for 57% of the total, are devoted to answers from MBA alumni who graduated three years ago. Six categories, weighted for 20% of the rankings total are devoted to international aspects of MBA programs, including course experience and extra languages. Three categories about women — faculty, students and women on advisory boards — are weighted for 5% of the total. Faculty with doctorates (5%) and corporate social responsibility (3%) complete the categories.\\nOnly programs accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International (AACSB) or EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) were eligible to participate. (The Jindal School has AACSB accreditation). In all, 143 colleges and universities took part.\\nFull-Time MBA\\nView all posts by Kristine Imherr\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Christensen- July 5th, 2018 -Academics,Alumni,Corporate,Faculty/Research,Students\\nTwo recent graduates of theNaveen Jindal School of Managementtook home a bronze medal from Paris in a global competition to improve customer service with artificial intelligence and chatbots.\\nVishal Kamble and Aman Mulkalwar won third place on July 3 in theAtos IT Challengefor their entry Electra for the Utilities, a cloud-based chatbot that can reduce costs and provide better customer service in the utilities industry. The pair received a cash award of 3,000 euros. (Kamble’s presentation about Electra begins at 48:48 in theevent video.)\\n“It’s very exciting,” Kamble said. “This was all new to us, and we really had to struggle to get this project done.”\\nThe annual contest is sponsored byAtos, a European IT company with offices around the world. The competition is open to any student enrolled in a college, university or engineering school.\\nThis year, Atos challenged students to come up with an idea and build a prototype using artificial intelligence (AI) and conversational interfaces — or chatbots — that could help customers and businesses alike.\\nWorking with Amazon’s web cloud services, Kamble and Mulkalwar devised Electra to provide immediate answers to utilities customers, 24 hours a day, via text message, Amazon’s Alexa, Facebook Messenger and virtual reality.\\n“All companies compete to have top-quality products or services, but customer service is what gives them an edge,” Mulkalwar said. “Our idea gives customers a smooth, great experience: Basically, you’re talking to a virtual person who knows the answers to pre-set questions.”\\nThe gold medal went to Columbia University students for “BTM Solutions,” which unlocks automated demand response by using real-time electricity prices. The silver medal was awarded to students from Russia’s Voronezh State University who designed “Masterpiece,” a mobile app that lets you discuss art with a chatbot.\\nThe contest started last fall, and in December, judges from Atos chose Electra from 200 entries from several countries and put it on a shortlist of 20. After that, each shortlisted team met with a coach to provide technical and business insights: Kamble and Mulkalwar joined forces with Dr. Prakash Shrivastava, an Atos employee who also serves as a JSOM lecturer  in theSystems Engineering and Managementprogram.\\n“Their idea required a lot of patience, hard work and testing,” said Shrivastava, who joined Kamble in Paris for the awards ceremony. “The fact that Vishal and Aman’s entry made it so far in a global competition is a great accomplishment.”\\nKamble said Shrivastava’s mentorship and guidance was the key to their success.\\n“As students, our habit is to push everything until the last moment, but he motivated us to follow the timelines, plan everything, and keep this six-month project on track,” Kamble said.\\nBoth Kamble and Mulkalwar graduated in May. Kamble, an MS in Business Analytics alumnus, already has been hired as a full-time analytics consultant at Atos, where he had previously interned. He said there was no conflict of interest in entering the Atos IT Challenge because the contest is based in France and involves tech innovation, while his Atos internship was in the U.S. and focused on marketing.\\nAn MS in Information Technology and Management graduate, Mulkalwar was so busy with his job search he could not attend the awards ceremony in Paris. His focus paid off: He just landed a job with Dell in Austin.\\n“JSOM gave us the resources and the inspiration to implement the idea in real life,’’ he said. “The diverse and comprehensive coursework definitely contributed towards the fruition of this idea.”\\nAIArtificial IntelligenceMS Business Analytics and Artificial IntelligenceMS Information Technology and ManagementMS Systems Engineering and Management\\nView all posts by T.D.

Just try once and before you know it, it is going to become easy and natural! Being open to criticism is also a key to being successful.\\nI believe in defining moments. I believe that everyone has their own defining moments. I can give you an example here. My dad was in the military; because of that, we had to travel all over the world. Believe it or not, by nature I am an introverted person. It was right before my fifth birthday, and we had already moved four or five times. We were moving again from Hawaii to Washington state, and I started whining in my squeaky little voice, “But Dad!! I just made friends here and attended three birthday parties. It took such a long time to make that happen!”\\nTo which my dad was quick to reply, “Monica you have to understand that because of the career that I have, we will keep moving. You have to accept that. Do not be shy; just get out of your comfort zone, because if you want to go to a birthday party, you have to make that happen!”\\nI had to be OK with being extraverted — if not I was not going to have birthday parties or friends! That was inspirational enough. My career also expects me to be that. My private time back home helps me get that introvert energy back. It’s a balancing act, I would say.\\nOther self-defining moments involve my remarkable bosses and the remarkable gifts and attributes that I have acquired from them, such as the ability to listen, be compassionate, work hard and be forgiving.\\nSmile even when you don’t feel like it\\nEven when I don’t feel great, I know that if a put on a smile, I will figure out a way. I force that attitude on my students too. People have no option but to be cheerful when they are around me.\\nI don’t believe in luck, I believe that people create their own luck. When I was a kid, and when I said, “Jeez! I got real lucky,” my dad would point out, “No Monica! You make your own luck.”\\nHard Work\\nHard work is a life choice and is involuntary to me — just like breathing is.\\nSuccess\\nSuccess is what you feel inside. It’s not about the money, promotion or certificate; but it is that little voice inside you saying, “Yes, I did it!”\\nLove is the heartbeat of humanity. One of the great things about Jindal School is its amazing environment. We are so diverse, in looks, thoughts, dress, food we eat and languages we speak; but all of us have the same heartbeat representing love, which makes us this unique group of humans…so strong and powerful; and when we realize that, anything and everything is possible.\\nLike my dad says, “Life is what you make of it, Monica!” If you don’t make anything out of it, then you really don’t have any life.\\nAs a leader, always demonstrate humility. I showcase to everyone that I am indeed an imperfect being. I share my mistakes and also what I learnt from those mistakes, and eventually my team understands that there is nothing to be intimidated about.\\nRealize that when you don’t give up and when you keep pursuing a problem, you will eventually figure out a solution.\\nI also ensure that an equal level playing field is provided as I never want anyone to feel that I am above them, but rather with them. That in itself eliminates ego. Everybody knows that sometimes we need to take some precarious journeys to get to certain decisions, and while we are at it, we might as well have some fun and have one heck of a story to tell, when it is over.\\nI have in fact been writing a book; it is called “Walk around Naked.” It has 13 chapters, with each chapter dealing with a piece of advice someone has given me over the years. I have been working on it for about four to five years now, and it will be published sometime in the near future.\\nYou must be wondering about the odd title. A week before my marriage, I went to my grandmother for some advice, and she said, “Walk around naked.” This is what it essentially means: You have to be authentically who you are and be at absolute ease and comfort with that authentic self of yours.\\nIf you have noticed, I always wear spike high heels. My grandma was born sometime around 1907; she was a very stylish lady and left behind about 70 pairs of spike high heels. I wear them to honor her.\\nDon’t become boring.\\nDon’t become outdated.\\nDon’t become conventional.\\nDon’t become limited.\\nDon’t lose your curiosity.\\nDon’t lose your capacity to forgive.\\nAlways wear heels even when you are old.\\nMy father was an incredible mentor. He also had the most amazing laugh. I can hear it even now.\\nI suspect that in one decade I’ll be right here taking care of Jindal students. I feel very honored to serve the Jindal School and to mentor, guide and educate tomorrow’s business leaders. I often marvel at the notion that I get paid to do my job; I am very fortunate to be in this position.\\nAll of you Jindal students: take one single moment out of your life right now to stop and think where you are and the privilege you have to be right here, right now, at this time, with these people, setting the direction for your life.']},\n",

More retweets equal higher relevance.”\\nTwitter provides access to its historical data, and there is a lot of it, both useful attributes for detailed analysis, McKone said. “Also, Twitter can be a driver for trends.”']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyMichelle Abuda- September 11th, 2015 -Joining JSOM\\nAnyone who knew me during the early years of undergrad also knew my best friend, Annie. We were a crazy duo: inseparable, unstoppable and ready to “change the world.” As freshmen, we were already set on making a difference at this school.\\nFreshman year first semester, a lot of us business students sign up for Business Law with Associate Dean ofUndergraduate ProgramsMatt Polze. Super excited and clinging to every word of Polze’s lectures, I listened as he casually mentioned that the business school used to have a book club, but it hadn’t really been around. Of course after hearing this, Annie and I figured this would be a good project for us. We wanted to read books and become smart, educated young adults, so why not do it with other students?\\nI remember sitting in the residence hall, discussing where to go next. (Annie and I lived a few doors down from each other, because we were in the business students’ hall.) A book club sounded simple enough: Students should get together and discuss books. But there were so many logistics questions we had to brainstorm answers to:\\nHow often should we meet?\\nWhere should we meet?\\nWho selects the books we read?\\nShould professors/staff be involved?\\nDo we want to be a formal student organization?\\nBefore we could have a book club, we needed to have the answers to these questions. We wanted students to be involved and to have discussions, but we also wanted to give faculty the opportunity to come in and share their thoughts. We did not want students to be intimidated by faculty members, either. How could we expect our guests to be comfortable talking about a book we selected? Where should we even get the books to choose from, out of the millions of options that we have?\\nThe model we decided on was to have two meetings a month, with the first meeting run by students and the second run by a faculty member. The book would be chosen by our guest, so they would actually feel comfortable talking about it. After we asked Caryn Berardi, associate director of theDavidson Management Honors Program, to be our advisor, we also asked her to use the cozy DMHP Lounge as our meeting spot as well. Even though we aimed for business-related books and called ourselves the JSOM Book Club, the club’s doors were open to students of any major to attend. And finally, the time we picked was a time that was convenient for us (and adjusted for our guest, if necessary).\\nWe filed paperwork at theStudent Organization Center, went to a couple of meetings, and we had a club! We took Polze’s course in the fall of our freshman year, but after all of the brainstorming, meetings, trainings and getting set up, our first meeting was not until April the following spring. However, we had created a place where students could come and honestly discuss their opinions on leading business books, and then a few weeks later network with professors and staff to learn their thoughts.\\nStarting an organization from scratch was an incredibly rewarding experience: We had the opportunity to select our first officer team, and to work with so many great professors and read awesome books. Annie and I ran the organization as co-presidents for a year, before turning the club over to a new set of leaders. In my opinion, one of the most rewarding aspects of it all is the fact that the JSOM Book Club, three years old, is still running today.\\nOne funny memory I have of book club was when Annie emailed Tony Hsieh, author of Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose (New York: Grand Central Publishing, 2010), to see if he would come to our school to talk. For a little bit, it actually sounded like he was going to visit. Unfortunately, we would have had to pay for his flight and hotel, and it was a lot more than we had bargained for. We told his company that we wouldn’t be able to support Tony’s visit; they sent us a box of his books — autographed — instead! Even if you’re a new organization just starting out, it definitely doesn’t hurt to dream big and see what resources are out there.\\nTo learn more about the JSOM Book Club, follow us on Twitter at:@JSOMBookClub.']},\n",

Imperial Sugar, based in Sugar Land, was refined from locally grown sugarcane. During World War II, the U.S. government established regulations that gave Imperial Sugar an almost exclusive right to distribute sugar in Texas. Following the war, Hite worked with the company to continue its strong market presence. Imperial’s advertising emphasized the purity of sugar. The agency created a cookbook that consumers could order by sending in the “Pure Cane Sugar” tag found on each bag. They advertised heavily in print and on the radio, sponsoring a popular radio program that featured The Stamps-Baxter Quartet.\\nHite learned the Borden Milk business from the ground up.  He arose at dawn to ride on a milk delivery route, even learning to load the truck. He asked shoppers why they purchased Borden Milk and then used their answers to develop Borden’s advertising campaign. In one of the more memorable campaigns, Hite promoted Borden buttermilk as a post-holiday hangover cure. The ads, which ran in December and early January, featured the slogan “Bounce Back with Buttermilk” and included a hangover sympathy card to be sent to friends along with a  jug of Borden buttermilk.\\nHite effectively used television and celebrity endorsements for Haggar slacks. One memorable television spot showed Haggar’s Forever-Prest slacks being crumpled and wadded up and then crushed by a steam roller.  The pants were then held up and shown to be wrinkle-free. The ad was so effective that within 24 hours after its first run, Gimbels department store sold its entire Haggar slacks inventory and demanded a rush shipment. Hite also arranged celebrity endorsements from Mickey Mantle and Roger Staubach.\\nMrs. Baird’s Bread was a long-standing client.  Ninnie Baird began selling her bread to support her family after her husband’s death in 1912. Hite effectively used the Baird family’s story to market the bread. Some of his more famous slogans were “Stays fresh longer” and “From the Baird family to you.” Mrs. Baird’s Bread still emphasizes the bread’s freshness and the company’s family heritage as they celebrate 100 years in business.\\nMaryland Club Coffee, an upscale product of the Duncan Coffee Company, benefited from Hite’s creative approach. Although the product cost more per pound than any of its competitors, Hite convinced consumers it actually cost less than other brands since its richness meant less coffee was needed to make each cup.  Hite’s slogan, “The coffee you’d drink if you owned all the coffee in the world,” was featured in ads showing Dallas socialites drinking Maryland Club Coffee.\\nLearn more about the Morris Hite Center.']},\n",

Organizations may have risk management programs to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks to their assets, including threats from natural disasters, accidents, legal trouble, and financial hardships.\\nThe Jindal School of Management offers a Risk Management and Insurance Concentration to the Bachelor’s in Business Administration, Finance, or Global Business degrees. Students who pursue this concentration can establish careers as risk analysts, claims professionals, underwriters, and more.\\nRMIS courses are open to students who are interested in learning more about risk management regardless of their major. A popular starter course in risk management is the Foundations of Risk Analytics and Applications class (RMIS 4338). This course has no prerequisites and is taught by professor Steven Haynes.\\nProfessor Haynes created RMIS 4338 to provide undergraduates with a baseline understanding of how data is used to make decisions. During the class, students explore how data is collected, analyzed, and applied to help businesses prosper.\\n“The course is really engineered to be a course that focuses on the tools that we use to help solve problems.” Professor Haynes says. “One of the things that students are always interested in is how do we use data to figure out what’s right and what’s not right.”\\nProfessor Haynes encourages students to apply what they learn in class to modern problems that companies encounter. Every class begins with a discussion on what’s happening in major current events and how it relates back to risk analytics. The class projects are based on case studies from actual business data problems. Professor Haynes gives his students a basic description for their project and then provides them with room to think about how to solve the data problem.\\n“To me, what it comes down to is real-world problem solving with data.” Professor Haynes says.\\nStudents who take RMIS 4338 may face a paradigm shift in their way of thinking. Professor Haynes leans into case studies and class discussion to help students break away from simply memorizing concepts and move toward applying skills in a meaningful way.\\n“I think that has been really hard for some students, especially some of my finance students, who have been so task-focused through the years.” Professor Haynes said.']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyJindal School- May 23rd, 2022 -Academics,Events,Students\\nThis spring, theNaveen Jindal School of Management’ssignature scholarship program reached several milestones.\\nTheJindal Young Scholars Program, a partnership between the Jindal School and the Dallas Independent School District, announced its largest student cohort to date. The following week, four members of JYSP’s inaugural 2018 cohort graduated.\\nA Signing Day celebration was held May 6 at the Davidson Auditorium and the adjoining atrium to announce the fifth cohort, which consists of 11 students – the largest cohort to date, which includes a sibling of JYSP’s second cohort, also a first.\\nThe fifth cohort is record-breaking in other ways, too; not only is it the largest cohort thus far, but it also includes the first scholarship recipient from Roosevelt High School, representing all five participating DISD schools for the first time. Out of the 11 scholarship recipients, eight are first-generation college students.\\n“Graduating the first cohort of scholarship recipients is a testament to the hard work and excellence exhibited by each graduate,” said Program Director Billy Schewee. “It serves as both a symbol of the progress the program has made thus far and as a precursor of what is yet to come.”\\nThe five DISD schools are Moisés E. Molina High School, Franklin D. Roosevelt High School, H. Grady Spruce High School, W.T. White High School and the Marvin E. Robinson School of Business and Management at Yvonne A. Ewell Townview Center.\\nHundreds of students at the five high schools participate in various activities designed to support the academic, social and emotional development of the students and increase their chances of postsecondary readiness for collegiate and career success. To qualify for the scholarship, students must participate in the Jindal Young Scholars program throughout high school, maintain a high GPA and be admitted to The University of Texas at Dallas in a management program at the Jindal School.\\nThe members of the fifth cohort and their intended majors are:\\nThe fifth cohort also includes some familiar faces. Chris Adkins, a junior in the Information Technology and Systems Area and member of the second JYSP cohort, welcomed his brother Ross Adkins to the fifth cohort. This is the program’s first set of siblings. “We are just over the moon … to have both of our sons now in the Jindal [School] with full scholarships,” said Mrs. Adkins, Chris and Ross’s mother. “It is truly a blessing and we know they will continue to make us all proud.” Chris adds, “It makes it even better to be in the program and to be able to participate in everything JYSP does together.”\\nOf the four JYSP scholars who graduated this spring,  two will be entering the workforce and two will remain at UTD to pursue master’s degrees. The four graduates are Giovanny Lopez and Jason Manzala, BS of Finance, and Jacob Gonzalez and Ariana Morales, BS of Accounting.\\nTo date, the program has awarded 22 scholarships.

Podcast\\nbyVarghese Jacob- October 24th, 2022 -Business School,College Knowledge,Student Life\\nContents\\nWhat is Volunteer Income Tax Assistance?\\nAccounting Students Receive Tax Assistance Training\\nWhat is VITA like for Student Volunteers?\\nWhat Happens After VITA for Student Volunteers?\\nHow Do Students Get Involved in VITA?\\nFiling taxes can pose a unique challenge for people with disabilities, the elderly, or non-fluent English speakers. Households with low-income levels may also have difficulty obtaining tax assistance they can afford.\\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) supports an initiative to help people who may require assistance with taxes. Run by various partner organizations across the nation, the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program provides free tax preparation services to qualifying taxpayers.\\nThe VITA program in Dallas and Richardson, TX, benefits from the diligent work of student volunteers from the Naveen Jindal School of Management. Prior to their service in VITA, UT Dallas students undergo certification training to better assist individuals with their tax returns. This training period and the hours spent helping prepare taxes for qualifying people helps meet the 100 hours of community service required for JSOM undergraduate degrees.\\nStudent volunteers can apply to work with VITA starting in December. Training for certification takes place in January, and students must score a passing grade on their exam to be cleared to volunteer. When tax season begins in February, the student volunteers join other volunteers at their official VITA sites on weeknights or weekends to help people prepare their taxes.\\nTo help people quickly and efficiently, student volunteers are required to know their material well. A site-coordinator is available in case of tougher tax questions, but for the most part students are left to work one-on-one with qualifying taxpayers.\\nWhile tax concepts and technical skill are at the forefront of what students take away from the VITA program, it also offers students the opportunity to practice the universal skills needed to work with people. UT Dallas accounting student Marisol Dominguez, who participated in VITA during the 2021 tax season, says the program helped build her skillset in communication and customer service.\\nVITA empowers student volunteers with the knowledge, skills, and experience to take the next steps in their professional and academic journeys.\\nPrior to joining VITA, accounting student Phi Nguyen had not taken any classes on taxes yet. She participated in VITA in the spring of 2021 and took her first classes in taxes that summer. Her experience in VITA helped provide a foundation for her classwork, allowing her to see the real-world applications of what she was studying. Putting VITA on her resume also led to her being a top applicant for her Spring 2023 internship with a tax consulting firm called Baker Tilly.']},\n",

The award nomination emphasized venture acceleration and the Startup Launch Track, a unique curriculum within theNaveen Jindal School of Management’sMS in Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program. Established last year, the track affords select students $25,000 in seed capital, laboratory and/or office space, and specialized help to launch new enterprises as they earn their degrees.\\nThe innovation award is the second JSOM has earned from the consortium.

Faculty members pared the field down to the final five teams, which were then judged by a panel of five Nokia executives. The finalist teams were assigned mentors from Jindal School faculty, to help them prepare for the final presentations to Nokia, as well as offered office hours with Nokia subject matter experts.\\n“This competition was unique in the sense that students were provided with a business problem to solve without being provided with any specific data,” Bunn said. “The world of 5G is continuing to grow. Right now, it is the biggest thing that is going on in technology. This is a problem that I am currently facing in my role at Nokia. [We wanted to] see what they [could] do with it.”\\nStudents spent several weeks working on this problem, researching, holding team meetings, and preparing to address a challenge as they might do in the real world. On Nov. 17, the judges from Nokia selected the winning team.\\xa0Contestants\\xa0were evaluated on quality, confidence, creativity, and teamwork.\\nNamrata Kukreja, an MBA-MS Information Technology and Management student; Ji Li, an Economics PhD student; Saheba Priyadarshni, an MS Marketing student;\\xa0and Sandhya Sunder, an MS in Finance student; were on the winning team. They each received $750. The rest of the prize money was distributed among the other finalists.\\nKukreja said the competition was the perfect opportunity for her to apply her technical knowledge; gain insights on technology consulting and business strategy and hone her public speaking skills.\\n“I had a wonderful experience working with a diverse team and presenting to Nokia leadership,” she said. “As the team lead, I encouraged my teammates to focus on their strengths in fields including technology, business, market research, strategy and finance. Bringing together our varied core competencies was instrumental in our success. Our key to winning was consistency and forming an effective team dynamic to create an organic flow during our presentation. We aspired to win from day one and hoped to be among the top three closer to the competition day. When it came down to announcing the winning team, we were hopeful, but cognizant of our strong competitors. After our team number was called out, we were on cloud nine!”\\xa0“Mark Bunn asked for the resumes of all 25 of the students who were in the finals,” Bose said. “The winning team was invited to present to Nokia leadership on November 29, 2022.\\n“I have seen it repeatedly where we are in the middle of an advisory board meeting, and industry leaders have been so impressed with our students that they get a job offer right in front of me,” Bose said.\\xa0“I am happy to help students launch their careers through my industry contacts.”\\nView all posts by Jindal School\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

              "  'chunks': ['From South America to Texas, Finance Student Focuses on Making an Impact\\nAlumni Spotlights\\nTestimonials\\nNewsletters\\nG.O.A.T. Podcast\\nbyCaryn Berardi- September 9th, 2018 -Academics,Students\\nSebastian Cadario has several reasons why he chose to pursue his graduate finance education at theNaveen Jindal School of Management, including impressive rankings and the reputation of JSOM in the business community. But there was another reason ─ being close to his beloved Dallas Cowboys.\\nA native of Santa Cruz, Bolivia ─ where soccer reigns supreme ─ Cadario became a Cowboys fan in his youth and gets goosebumps when he thinks about his first game at AT&T Stadium. But football was not his only interest as a child. From an early age, he loved numbers and excelled at math.\\nWhen it came time for university, Cadario knew he wanted to study in the United States. He found his way to Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, earning a bachelor’s degree in finance and management before returning home to Bolivia to begin a career in banking and, later, insurance. Eventually he wanted more.\\n“I always wanted to do a master’s degree. That was my dream,” Cadario said. “And with political strife in my country, I thought it was now or never if I wanted to go back to the U.S.”\\nNow in his second year of theMS in Financeprogram and on track to graduate next year, Cadario uses the knowledge and professionalism he gained through his work experience, combined with his passion for helping people, to make an impact on campus.\\nLast summer he was the student assistant for the eighth annual nationwideUT Dallas Top Trader Competitionfor high school students. Participants were given $1 million in virtual currency to invest in a stock market simulator over eight weeks. Cadario kept the students engaged with weekly contact.\\n“I needed someone who could just take the responsibilities and run with them,” said Kristin Spain, academic support coordinator for theBS in Financeprogram and Top Trader manager. “Sebastian gave the students something more than just the competition.”\\nWhile his main task was to write and distribute a weekly newsletter, Cadario sent two each week. One focused on the competition rankings, and one was investment-related news and resources for the students.\\n“When I was younger and learned the stock market wasn’t just about numbers, but about projection, it made me fall in love with math all over again,” he said. “I wanted to help the students find their own investment strategies for the competition, but in doing so I learned so much from this information too.”\\nSpain praises Cadario for his “amazing work ethic,” andDr. Carolyn Reichert, clinical associate professor and MS in Finance program director, echoes that praise. She has witnessed Cadario’s hard work through his involvement in the Graduate Finance Management Council. Cadario joined in January 2018 as part of the organization’s inaugural class of students who serve as ambassadors of the program and peer mentors. The application process looks for students who are engaged and committed.\\n“His enthusiasm, commitment, patience and knowledge have made him a valuable ambassador and mentor,” Reichert said.\\nWhile Cadario developed many skills through professional experience, he credits his work ethic to his mom, who raised him on her own and whom he never saw complain about working hard. While being away from her is difficult, he is excited about a future in the States after graduation.\\n“Ideally, I want to stay [in Dallas], get a good job, build a family and find a way to give back,” Cadario said. “And of course, go to every Cowboys game.”\\nMS Finance\\nView all posts by Caryn Berardi\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

              "  'chunks': ['“We started looking at who produces green patents for several reasons,” Gurun said. “We wanted to see which companies are paving the way to a better, cleaner environment through innovative activities. When we saw that most of the top green-patent producers are energy companies, we were at first puzzled.\\n“We then started to think about the incentive structures that made these traditional energy companies respond in this particular way in an era where more and more people are advocating more environmentally sound and socially responsible energy use.”\\nHe and his colleagues were also interested, Gurun said, to see if and how ESG considerations — which the U.S. Department of Labor in 2015 released as guidelines to bear in mind in investment decisions — factored into energy innovation.\\nData Derived From Green Patents\\nGurun, Cohen and Nguyen based their study on an investigation of green patents, those that help protect and preserve the environment through technological innovation concerning waste, wind power, geothermal energy, solar energy and tidal energy, according to a definition popularized by the international Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development.\\nAs of 2019, Gurun’s study notes, “sustainable investing represents more than 20 percent of the $46 trillion in U.S. assets under management. Compared to 2015, sustainable and impact investing has increased by more than 40%.”\\nEven so, Gurun, Cohen and Nguyen discovered, “a sizable percentage of recent green patenting is driven not by highly rated ESG firms, firms that are commonly favored by ESG funds, but instead by firms that are explicitly excluded from the ESG funds investment universe.”\\nIn fact, the researchers found “consistent and robust markers that the quantity and quality of green patenting is higher for energy firms” and that “these firms are precisely those to which capital is often restricted by mandates and campaigns whose directive is to solve the important problems linked to green innovation.”\\nUsing two databases, one a patent-citation and patent-assignment record, and the other a record of environmental scores taken from Sustainalytics ESG Ratings; the researchers studied patterns in green patenting and focused on publicly traded companies because these offered “rich, publicly available measures of firm characteristics, external activities, income, profitability and patent holdings.”\\nHigh Scores for Traditional Energy Companies\\nResults showed that of the top 50 green-patent producers in 2017, 14% — or seven of them — were energy companies excluded by many ESG-favored funds. The firms were BP, Chevron, Conoco Phillips, Exxon Mobil, Honeywell International, Royal Dutch Shell and U.S. Oil, and collectively, they held 6,969 green patents.\\nTabulation showed that on average, 56 industries per year were producing green patents during the study period of 2008 to 2017. The researchers learned the energy sector had nearly three times the focus on green innovation as other industries and that nearly 25% of the energy industry’s innovation lay in green research.\\nChecking to see if energy companies were merely trying to appear engaged in green patenting without impacting the fossil-fuel components of their businesses, Gurun and his co-authors found that the energy industry had a significantly larger percentage of its innovation efforts going specifically toward alternative-energy innovation relative to all other industries — almost three times as much.\\nFactoring in ESG Scores\\nThe researchers next checked:\\nIf companies with better environmental scores contributed more green patents.\\nIf a green patent was more likely to come from a better- or worse-scored ESG company, and\\nIf a green patent was more likely to come from a company in the energy sector.\\nTheir findings showed two strong patterns: 1) that a green patent was more likely to come from a poorly scored ESG company, and 2) that energy firms had both significantly lower environmental scores but also were large and important producers of green patents.\\nDespite this production, Gurun and his co-authors found, energy companies got less credit in their ESG scores for their green patents. Outside the energy sector, other top green-patent firms both had significantly higher ESG scores on average, and were rewarded more for green-patenting activity.\\nGurun said he and his colleagues have recently uncovered new patterns in citation data that suggest “energy firms’ patents are wide-reaching green innovations, that everyone is benefiting from them.”\\nThey also have found that fossil fuel companies’ green-energy patents produce more kilowatts of alternative energy than those of green-energy firms.\\n“All these results suggest,” Gurun said, “that companies that are often barred from ESG portfolios are paving the way in the green- patenting world.

BisNet members came from business schools across the nation to discuss, collaborate, and share insights on maintaining active study abroad and international exchange programs.\\nWhile gathered at JSOM, BisNet members observed a keynote address by UT Dallas associate professor, Dr. Timothy Bray, on Covid-19 and future pandemics. In the following sessions, BisNet members participated in conversations surrounding risk management, marketing global programs, and faculty-led trips abroad.\\nFounded in 2002, BisNet gathers representatives from leading business schools that have thriving study abroad and international exchange programs. Together, BisNet members tackle the challenges that come with sending students around the globe, from generating interest to collaborating with international universities.\\nMembers of BisNet typically meet twice a year, once during the NAFSA: Association of International Educators conference and again in the fall at a participating business school. With the Covid-19 pandemic having thrown study abroad programs into disarray, BisNet members had more than enough to talk about at the 2022 conference.\\nKim Cahill, Director of the Moran Center for Global Leadership at the Villanova School of Business, and Gabrielle Mirasola, Assistant Director of the Global Experiences Office at NYU Stern School of Business led a Thursday afternoon session on marketing programs to students. Methods of marketing under discussion included word of mouth, faculty support, social media, ambassador programs, and search engine optimization of study abroad webpages.\\nCahill emphasized that one of the primary challenges in renewing interest in study abroad programs was the slim pool of current students who had been able to successfully complete a program, as the Covid-19 pandemic saw severe travel restrictions and the suspension of many programs. Without students to spread the word of their experiences abroad, many of the avenues for marketing, such as word of mouth and social media, were wanning. In several groups, the BisNet members discussed how to face this and other challenges in marketing programs to students.\\nFriday’s opening session was moderated by Phyllis Tutora, Senior Director for International Executive Programs at the Fox School of Business in Philadelphia, and Jennifer Hilton Montero, the Director of International Initiatives at UT Dallas. An opening topic of interest was the issue of decentralization in universities, and how most schools operate with autonomy which can mean less support from other schools in the realm of programs like study abroad and international exchange.\\nTutora and Montero shared what’s working and what’s been a challenge at their respective institutions, and then opened the floor for groups to exchange ideas. The moderators asked the discussion groups to think specifically about what has changed since the pandemic and what institutions have taken away from the experience.\\nFollowing a general business meeting on Friday afternoon, the BisNet conference concluded with some members promising to be present at the NAFSA: Association of International Educators conference, currently planned for end of May in 2023. Overall, the BisNet conference gives members the opportunity to work at improving their international education programs, focusing their institution’s efforts on gifting students with a more global perspective.\\nInspirationInternational StudyStudy AbroadStudy Abroad Programs\\nView all posts by Varghese Jacob\\nMore from Business School - Blog Category\\nStudent Spotlight: Anthony Chu\\nAnthony Chu is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and he is expected to graduate Dec. 2026.\\nStudent Spotlight: Dena Aljabari\\nDena Aljabari is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and Analytics and she is expected to graduate May 2025.\\nStudent Spotlight: Nnamdi Edeoga\\nNnamdi Edeoga is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management and is expected to graduate in May 2025.\\n5 Reasons to Study Risk Management and Cyber Security at UT Dallas\\nAn understanding of risk management and cybersecurity can help individuals create resilient businesses that can stand the test of potential threats.\\nStudent Spotlight: Madison Hill\\nMadison Hill is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management and a Bachelor of Science in Finance double-major and she is expected to graduate May 2026.\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Use these resources to determine a salary range to put in the application.\\nI have applied for hundreds of jobs but haven’t heard back. What am I doing wrong?\\nFor job applications, focus on quality not quantity. Tailor every resume and cover letter in your application process. Study the job description and make sure you are applying for jobs where you match the experience the company is seeking.  Use the job description to highlight specific skills that are listed. Lastly, either start networking or ramp up your networking as it is often the key to getting past the application to the interview invitation.\\nWhen should I start applying for internships and/or jobs?\\nApplication timelines vary by industry.  Many Fortune 500 companies recruit at least one semester in advance for internships and/or full-time positions.  Fall tends to be the peak recruiting time for the following summer.  It is important to stay connected with your degree program and the JSOM CMC to stay updated.  We also recommend frequently checking Handshake for updates about employer events, CMC workshops and internship/job opportunities.\\nCan employers find me on Handshake?\\nThe steps to increase your Handshake visibility include completing your profile to 100%; uploading a JSOM CMC formatted resume; ensuring your degree, GPA, work authorization and graduate date are accurate; setting your privacy setting to community or employers.  We recommend selecting the community setting for the best user experience for Handshake Virtual Career Fairs.\\nFAQs – Networking\\nWhat if I contact someone through LinkedIn or email and they don’t respond back?\\nWait two weeks and contact again.  If after that the person still doesn’t respond, move on to another contact.  Be patient for a response and be professional in all correspondence for best results.\\nCan I just apply for a job without networking if I concentrate on a large volume of applications?\\nOn average, every corporate job opening attracts 250 applicants. Since this is an average, it must also be true that for some jobs, there will be more that 250 applicants. Networking can help you to get singled out of the applicant pack to get invited to an interview.  Networking is essential in the job hunt. It seems complicated, but really it means talking to others about your job search and career goals. You are not networking to ask for a job. Networking helps you learn information about jobs that are being created, jobs that are “hidden” because they never get posted, and jobs that may not be currently open but will be posted in the future.']},\n",

To ensure your internship experience meets both your graduation requirement and helps you achieve your career goals, here are a few things you should keep in mind when applying:\\nThe employer must be a registered business that has no red flags with UTD.\\nThe company must have an in-office location.\\nThe internship must be related to your degree or major.\\nYou should have a supervisor who will act as your mentor during your internship.\\nYou need an environment in which you are challenged to learn and supported throughout.\\nYou can increase your chances of getting a great internship offer by following these steps:\\n1. Research Companies\\nEvery professional journey should start with identifying the companies that offer the kinds of opportunities you are looking for. Start your search early and learn the timing of recruitment for employers. Some employers offering summer internships will open applications for the positions in the fall.\\nCheck outHandshakefor employers looking for undergraduate students like you.\\n2. Create Your Targeted Résumé\\nCraft your résumé with your preferred employer and position in mind.

You can meet contacts who work in your desired profession or industry at career fairs, student organization events or through your volunteer efforts. Expand your circle of contacts by joining Join localMeetupgroups and professional associations. Ask your new contacts about potential opportunities at their workplaces.\\nWhen you identify a company you would like to work for, you can send appropriate introductions over LinkedIn and by email to contacts within that company.\\n4.

At first we thought it would be something small but a point that needed to be made. Now, seeing it come to fruition with spin-offs on campus and as a national movement in which students all over have better awareness about the issue — it’s been rewarding.”\\nMore recently, the committee has focused on mental-health awareness and solving such game-environment problems as inappropriate behavior by fans and parents toward visiting teams and participants.\\n“We expect heckling from students,” Weber said. “We see them as our equals, so it isn’t a big deal. We portray their remarks as just trying to get in our heads to help their team win — also, they are attending that university and thus representing it. But we draw a line when parents and other family members display inappropriate behavior toward students and referees. We see it as coming from a degrading and derogatory place. They are not representing their institution and really should be more mature than that.”\\nAs a committee member, Weber also has a voice in influencing NCAA legislation. He spoke on the floor of the NCAA convention last January in front of 1,500 people about allowing student-athletes to use student-athlete only facilities outside the playing and practice season and spoke in opposition to allowing student-athletes to participate in university fundraisers involving athletics ability. He also got to witness committee members as they changed the minds of conference commissioners, athletic directors and university presidents when they gave voice to fellow student-athletes’ concerns.\\n“Seeing how much a student-athlete’s voice is represented, particularly in Division III, is amazing,” Weber said. “It’s already given me a glimpse into what I want to do as a career,” he said. “I’m looking into getting a master’s in sports administration now.”\\nWeber has applied for a postgraduate internship with the NCAA. The position would help move him toward his goals of continuing to be involved behind the scenes in athletics, perhaps in governance within the NCAA or in compliance or development at a university, and eventually becoming an athletic director or conference commissioner.\\nFor now, Weber is focusing on his studies and his new role in SAAC leadership after having completed a successful soccer season with a record of 13-5-2. The Comets won the regular-seasonAmerican Southwest Conference (ASC)title as well as theASC Tournamenttitle. They went on to compete in the NCAA Division III tournament, where they lost in the opening round.

Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- March 1st, 2022 -Academics,Events\\nThe Naveen Jindal School of Management kicked off its inaugural2022 Sustainability Competitionwith a webinar that focused on how innovation and entrepreneurship can be applied to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals to help solve sustainability problems.\\nThe competition is a collaboration of theSustainable Global Business Initiativein theCenter for Global Business, theCenter for Information Technology and Management,and two student organizations: theSociety of Sustainable Businessand theConsulting Leadership & Development Society.\\nRobert Skinner, deputy director and chief of Partnerships and Global Engagement, Outreach Division, United Nations Department of Global Communications, was the keynote speaker for the event, held virtually Jan. 31. His presentation — The Intersection of Sustainability and Entrepreneurship: Why the SDGs are Critical to Entrepreneurs and Innovators — explained what the United Nations does, where the SDGs come from, the challenges the organization sees ahead, and how entrepreneurs and business people can contribute to achieving and sustaining those goals.\\nThe SDGs provide “a common language for everyone to use as we strive to lift people out of poverty, provide livelihoods to everyone and keep the planet healthy,” he said. “You can look at the downsides and negative things we’re trying to fight against, but then think about where we’re trying to go by 2030 and it’s really a positive agenda by making sure that we’re being inclusive, giving everyone opportunity and all pushing in the same direction.”\\nSkinner said that in the lead-up to the creation of the SDGs, a variety of stakeholders were consulted, including those from the business community and academia.\\n“I, for one, am convinced that if there would not have been that push — from the business sector, from the NGO community, from academia, from philanthropy — that the governments would not have adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, that this agenda would not exist,” he said. “The world needs the entrepreneurs, the young thinkers to take on these big challenges and identify and create solutions that work for people. And that’s both at the global level, which I think a lot of people think of the UN working, but also at the local level, which is where a lot of my colleagues … are actually doing their jobs.”\\nDr. Habte Woldu, director of the SGBI, said the purpose of the webinar was to teach Jindal School students the importance of sustainability through the UN’s 17 SDGs.\\n“I hope that the student entrepreneurs who attended this webinar were as inspired as I was by Mr. Skinner’s excellent presentation,” he said. “More importantly, I encourage students to use that inspiration to develop innovative solutions to the critical global problems we face today. I am confident that these experiences will help students embark on paths toward becoming transformative leaders when they enter the workforce.”\\nRegistration for the 2022 Sustainability Competition closes on Friday, Feb. 4.

The work done that weekend benefitsIt’s Going toBe OKInc., an organization that works to bring awareness, help, hope and healing to those affected by human trafficking and sexual exploitation.\\nAccording to CEO and trafficking survivor Dr. Tonya Stafford Manning, Dallas ranks second in the nation for human trafficking cases. She founded the nonprofit 10 years ago. To date, the organization’s workers have rescued hundreds of human trafficking victims. They continue to search for those still trapped, rescue them, provide shelter, medical care, trauma therapy, education, life skills and job training.\\nThe hackathon was sponsored by Thanawala Digital (t.digital, a Salesforce consulting partner). Founder and CEO Moyez Thanawalla is an adjunct professor at JSOM. He was assisted byDr. Ron Bose, a professor of practice and director of theCenter for Information Technology and Management(CITM) at the Jindal School, and by the officers of theUTD Salesforce student chapter. The chapter provides training on Salesforce CRM technology to students and provides opportunities for members to network with industry professionals.\\n“Our company made a 1 percent pledge, and we agree to donate 1 percent of our time, money and product to benefit others. Small charities often don’t know how to get attention and we are trying to help with that. This event is a new quest for our charity events,” said Thanawalla. “We have been doing them for 12 years and this is the first time we have brought in individuals from companies. The students work side-by-side with team leaders from industry and magic happens.”\\nIn addition to working for the benefit of the charity, the hackathon provided students with the opportunity to meet and network with leaders from a range of companies.\\nMohammed Allama Hossain, an MS, computer science student at UTD and a Salesforce developer intern at t.Digital, described the hackathon as amazing.\\n“Weekends are usually about parties and having fun,” he said. “I attended a ‘working weekend event’ and it turned out to be one of the best experiences of my life. … It was exhilarating to see everyone from MVPs to students, from VPs to developers, come together, to brainstorm, discuss, debate, propose and develop a solution for Stafford Manning and the IGTBOK team to help support their commendable effort to eradicate human trafficking. In all my years of education, this is the best way I have put my theoretical class knowledge to practical use.”\\nUT Dallas Salesforce Student chapter leaders Pooja Solanki and Sai Pravallitha Vemireddy worked to organize student volunteers and hackathon participants.\\nSalesforce provided a free perpetual license for the system that was built in 36 hours by five teams led by experienced professionals from the Dallas Salesforce community. Team leaders were Paul McCollum, Accenture; Shawnee Scesney, t.digital; Navaid Hussain, USAA; Nishchitha Nagaraj, Capital One; and Sunitha Manne,\\xa0Salesforce, who earned a master’s in computer science from UT Dallas’ Erik Jonsson School of Engineering\\xa0 and Computer Science in 1994.\\nThey were supported by more than 30 industry volunteers from many companies including JPMorgan Chase and Cognizant.\\n“For all those who participated in this event, including UTD students and industry volunteers, this weekend was incredibly impactful at a personal and professional level,” Bose said. “It also allowed students to get visibility to potential employers.”\\nAshley Harvell, JPMorgan Chase, took part in the event to so that she could support the nonprofit.\\n“I also wanted to take advantage of the learning opportunity,” she said. “I’m in marketing and technology so this is a good fit.”']},\n",

One of the highlights of my internship was the ‘BEZAHL’ project, where we integrated a third-party payment option into Copart’s websites for Germany, Spain, and Finland. It wasn’t just about implementing a payment system—it was about ensuring a seamless user experience for customers in different countries. I worked closely with stakeholders, gathered requirements, and suggested ways to enhance the existing website. Seeing the project take shape and eventually go live was incredibly rewarding. Another pivotal project was ‘Esign’, aimed at delivering design documents for US states. This was a massive undertaking, but with careful planning, effective communication, and a collaborative approach, we delivered it successfully. It taught me the importance of attention to detail and working cohesively with cross-functional teams. As a Product Owner, I wore many hats—analyzing requirements, managing tasks in Jira, creating workflows using figma, and collaborating with QA and development teams. Testing the product, ensuring it was QA-approved, and facilitating UAT (User Acceptance Testing) gave me a comprehensive understanding of the product lifecycle. The thrill of presenting project demos in monthly review meetings to stakeholders, VPs, and team leads further sharpened my communication and presentation skills. Looking back, this internship has been more than just work—it’s been a masterclass in collaboration, problem-solving, and delivering impactful solutions. From learning the nuances of product development to understanding the global perspective of a business, this experience has shaped me professionally and personally. I am incredibly grateful for the journey so far and excited about what lies ahead. Lastly, I would like to thank our Program Director Professor Gaurav Shekhar for his guidance. #UTDMSBA\\nMore from CMC Internship Testimonials\\nShubham Ralli\\nCoding for Care: How Building Bots Made Me a Better Healthcare Innovator As a Data Automation and Operations Analyst intern at Eyes Now, I've had the incredible opportunity to revolutionize healthcare operations while working directly with CEO, Dr. Abraham.\\nSharayu Sanjay Sathe\\nReflecting on My Fall Internship Experience at Lennox International Inc.

Podcast\\nbyDonna Steph Rian- September 28th, 2016 -Alumni,Corporate,Development\\nHaving earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from UT Dallas and started her own online business, alumna Olia Bosovik now has set her sights on opening doors for other budding entrepreneurs.\\nAs assistant director of the UT Dallas Venture Development Center, Bosovik is helping develop and run new programs  — two at the moment. The first is a formal incubator program,VDIP, a nine-month program designed to assist startup companies that have already launched and are making progress, grow to the next level. The second is a Mentors Office Hours program, which provides on-site mentors available to counsel startups at the VDC Monday through Friday.\\n“Most startups don’t know it all, and we are here to help,” Bosovik says. “I work with startups, mentors and local companies, helping with networking and collaboration, in order to offer win-win relationships. Interacting with knowledgeable people in their industries is crucial for startups at this stage.”\\nBosovik grew up in Belarus, a small country south of Russia. Her parents moved to Texas, and she followed, at age 20.\\n“I really had no idea what I was doing then,” she says. “I wanted to go to college, but the education system is very different here. Back home, you go to school free. I realized I would have to work to earn money for college.”\\nBosovik became a full-time sales assistant at Ted Baker, an upscale British clothier in NorthPark Center in Dallas. She worked there five years and was promoted up the ranks to assistant store director while also taking a full load of classes, first at Richland Community College, then at UT Dallas.\\n“I met people who were going to UTD who told me that it was a great school, really affordable, and I’d get a great education, so I decided to transfer,” she says. “I may have missed out on that ‘college life’ a little bit because I was working full time, but I don’t regret it.”\\nBosovik excelled at UT Dallas, winning the Naveen Jindal School of Management’s firstOutstanding Undergraduate Finance Student awardand a Dean’s Excellence Scholarship twice. She graduated in 2012.\\nAfter graduation, Bosovik accepted a position as a senior credit risk analyst with Comerica Bank, where she worked two-and-a-half years. She also began graduate classes at UT Dallas, earning both an MS in accounting and an MBA in 2015.\\n“During my last semester of grad school, I had room for a sales class,” she says. “I took entrepreneurship and realized, ‘Oh my gosh,’ this is what I’ve always wanted — making a difference and working for yourself.”\\nDuring her last year of graduate school, Bosovik won a Rookie Preview sales competition.\\nAlso, a team of which she was a member finished third in the 2015 UT Dallas Business Idea Competition, where students develop and present business startup ideas to a panel of judges. The team’s model, designated TravelHop, later emerged as Travabond, a budget-focused online travel site offering trip planning, management, booking and more for women traveling together.\\n“When I found out Mark Cuban was one of the competition’s judges, I was determined we would win,” Bosovik says. “He told us it was a good idea but said it wasn’t a very good business model. We made some adjustments.”\\nToday, Travabond is “on the shelf for the moment,” she says, as its co-founders either work full time, as she does, or are still students.']},\n",

I am so grateful for this immensely educating opportunity where I gained invaluable insights into hospital operations and volunteer management. My main roles were to deal with seasonal compliance and safety protocols, serving as the point-of-contact for all volunteers, and facilitating events and onboarding processes. When collaborating with my mentors, I developed a profound understanding of the critical role volunteers play in enhancing the patient experience.\\nTina Dimitrova\\nHonors Student,University of Texas at Dallas\\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas\\nThe UTD Seed Fund Course has given me the opportunity to gain real world experience in the venture capital space.

We took three flights to get to Osaka, and a bus ride to get to Nara. I have been up for about two days straight, considering we crossed the International Date Line. Our first flight was through United Airlines, and we had a 5-hour layover in Houston. While in Houston, I grabbed some coffee at the airport Starbucks and book by Neil Gaiman entitled American Gods. During the layover, I tried to close my eyes for a bit and watch some Netflix using the free Wi-Fi. During the 13-hour flight to Narita Airport in Tokyo, I spent a great deal of time reading about half of the book I purchased in Houston. My classmate and I were uncertain about the video on demand service, and thought the inflight videos cost money due to the credit card reader on the side of the remote, so we decided not to even bother with extra cost.Read full story.\\nVivian Ekadi\\nFall 2023 Internship with Heart to Heart Hospice\\nDuring this past fall semester, I had the opportunity to work at Heart to Heart Hospice as an administration intern. I learned about building patient relationships, time management, and the inner workings of a hospice. Overall, I gained a lot of experience in the field and had the pleasure of working one-on-one with a mentor. My mentor was incredibly helpful in pointing out resources to aid me during the internship and offered critical advice for me to use.

On its own, two months in London itself is amazing. But I had the opportunity to work with some of the best people I possibly could. They helped me realize my potential as an individual in the workplace and out. For me, this was my first experience in a workplace that trusted me enough to let me learn by doing. Every time I was assigned a task, whoever was responsible for the task would patiently explain what they wanted done, how to do it, and why they do it that way. This way, I was able to learn various software experience and hone my skills in working in an international company.Read full story.\\nRose Ewing\\nFall 2024 Internship with Southwestern Health Resources\\nSouthwestern Health Resources (SWHR) is a patient centered, Clinically Integrated Network (CIN) formed between UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and Texas Health Resources (THR) with more than 7,000+ providers caring for over 790,000 patients, 31 hospitals, and over 650+ outpatient facilities and clinics across 14 counties over North Texas.

              "  'chunks': ['“To be in the company of other premier programs like the University of California – Berkeley, the universities of Michigan and of Virginia, UCLA and UT Austin is a clear indication that our school is a highly sought destination for highly competitive students as well as top employers seeking top talent,” saidDr. Hasan Pirkul, Jindal School dean and Caruth Chair.\\nIn the two years since the 2020 rankings were posted, the Full-Time MBA program has moved up seven places in all. “Our upward climb in the rankings,” Pirkul said, “speaks to our efforts to recruit the very best students, deliver an exceptional education and connect students with top employers.”\\nUT Dallas is the highest-ranking program in North Texas, and only two other universities in the state are among the most highly ranked programs, including The University of Texas at Austin (No. 18 tied) and Rice University (No. 25).\\nOther factors reflected in the ranking demonstrate that even during the pandemic, 90% of Jindal School MBA alums were employed within three months of graduation.\\n“We were so gratified that even when everything about career management was different, we were able to position our students in top jobs with highly competitive salaries,” said Lisa Shatz, assistant dean ofMBA Programs.\\nSpecialty Rankings\\nThe MBA standings also include rankings ofspecialty subjects. Among those, three appeared for the first time this year:\\nProject Management, No. 6\\nProduction/Operations, No. 24\\nBusiness Analytics, No. 28 (tied).\\nIn other specialty rankings, Information Systems moved up, from No. 16 last year to No. 13, and Supply Chain Management again tied at No. 21.\\nPart-Time MBA Program Rankings\\nThe Jindal School tied at No. 11 among public university part-time MBA programs in the 2022 rankings. It also tied with Arizona State University and Wake Forest University at No. 22 overall.\\nLike its Full-Time MBA counterpart, the Jindal School’sProfessional (part-time) MBA— which caters to employed individuals seeking to advance their careers — was also the highest-ranked program in North Texas.\\n“The past year required extra stamina from everyone, but part-time students in particular,” Shatz said. “In ordinary times, they juggle jobs, family and more to make school work. Add a pandemic to that, and you should understand why I offer kudos to all those who endured.”\\nMethodology\\nTo arrive at the rankings,U.S. News & World Reportsurveyed all 486 colleges and universities with master’s-level business programs in the United States accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International in fall 2020 and early 2021. Of those, 364 schools responded, and U.S. News received enough data to rank 143 of the respondents.\\nThe scoring system was comprised of:\\ntwo quality variables — reputation among other schools and reputation among employers,\\nplacement success, as measured by percentages of alumni employed at graduation and three months later and by average starting salaries, and\\nquality of incoming students, reflected by GRE and GMAT scores, mean undergraduate GPA and acceptance rates.\\nFull-Time MBAMS Business Analytics and Artificial IntelligenceMS Information Technology and ManagementMS Supply Chain ManagementPMBA Evening CohortPMBA Flex\\nView all posts by Kristine Imherr\\nMore from Academics - News Category\\nCompetition Challenges Undergraduate Students at Jindal School to Solve Real-World Problems\\nHealthcare EMBA at Jindal School Equips Future Healthcare Leaders\\nRetiring Jindal School Professor Leaves Lasting Legacy\\nJindal School Ranked No. 1 Online MBA Program in U.S.\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nRequest Information']},\n",

              "  'chunks': ['Faculty Research\\nCareers\\nJoint UT Effort Leads to Health Case Competition Success\\nTwo Naveen Jindal School of Management full-time MBA students recently joined three students from UT Southwestern Medical School and an engineering student from UT Arlington on a winning team that placed first and earned $6,000 in the International Emory Global Health Case Competition.\\nThe multidisciplinary UT group successfully responded to the competition challenge to reorganize the World Health Organization, a United Nations agency founded in 1948, to redefine its purpose and role in addressing global health issues in the 21st century. The team also won the Participants’ Choice Award, voted on by all competitors, for making the best presentation at the event.\\nSponsored by Emory University’s Global Health Institute, the annual competition focuses on worldwide health-related cases that require an interdisciplinary solution. This year, nearly 140 students from 24 universities across the United States and from Australia, Canada and Sweden competed. A team from Johns Hopkins University placed second, and a team from the University of Alberta placed third.\\n“This was such an unusual case competition in that it included UT students from three different schools, three different areas of study,” Lisa Shatz, JSOM assistant dean for MBA programs, said about the team fielded under UT Southwestern Medical Center’s name. “It was a great opportunity for business students to represent how the problem-solving skills taught in business school can be applied to any issue — in this case the World Health Organization.”\\nDetails and a dramatic face-to-face appeal made the winning difference for the UT team at the March 29 finals, according to JSOM participants Sarah (Jane) Slusher and Rohit Tyagi.\\nThe judges said “that we were the only team that whatever they asked, we had the answer,” Tyagi said.\\nAnd, responding to a finals-round twist — political criticism decrying WHO as too focused on Western ideals and too Westernized — Slusher made a direct appeal to the detractor. She addressed the man, role-playing the president of Russia, as well WHO’s board of directors in the team’s presentation close. Recalling past successful joint U.S.-Russian efforts to fight the polio pandemic, she said to the “pretend Putin” as she walked over to him, “If you don’t belong to organizations like this, you’re going to discount your population from global health.\\n“And then I said, ‘So, Russia, take a leap with us.’ And then I addressed everyone and said, ‘Take a leap with us.’ It was moving.”\\nLeap was an important word for the team because it called its reformation plan LEAP, short for Leaders Enabling Efficient Approaches Through Partners and Priorities.\\nThe team arrived at the plan after identifying three major problems, Tyagi said. One was an image issue, leading to increasing numbers of earmarked donations that tied up WHO’s funding and cost it autonomy. Another was lack of coordinated effort exacerbated by the freewheeling autonomy of some internal WHO groups. And the third was the challenge of faith-based, non-governmental and private organizations drawing away WHO donations by targeting specific health problems.\\nThe team addressed the image problem by rethinking WHO’s mission, recommending the organization change from running a “boots on the ground” operation that did everything to becoming a global facilitator. As Slusher put it: “We felt their real core competency wasn’t that they administer vaccines but rather that they have a global network to help organizations” they can identify as the best at doing specific vaccines in specific places.\\nFor funding issues caused by earmarking, “we told them to replicate the academic model,” Tyagi said. “Tell donors up front that a certain percentage of donated money will be reserved for general, uncommitted use and increase that percentage over time.”\\nOrganizationally, LEAP recommended phasing out autonomous internal groups while getting more buy-in from external faith-based, non-governmental and private stakeholders.\\nGraduating this spring with a risk assurance job in the Houston office of PwC waiting, Tyagi said the global perspective of the competition initially attracted him. “I would say I have a fierce interest in world politics,” he said.\\nSlusher worked for a patient advocacy company before pursuing her MBA and is focusing her studies on a career in healthcare management. Initially, she worried the competition would hinge on medical issues and answers. “When we got this case, I was actually a little relieved. I was like, organizational structure I can do. So I think having a team that had MBA students on it for this specific problem was awesome.”\\nMore from Rotator\\nAmerican Heart Association to Honor Associate Dean for Community Impact\\nAccounting Students Score Scholarships from the Texas Society of CPAs\\nBig Idea Competition Finals Will Put Kawasaki’s Art of Innovation on Display\\nThe iPhone X:  Will it pop or will it fizzle?\\nJindal School Alumna Earns Women in Technology Award\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Most recently, a team of four students placed second overall in the Western States Collegiate Sales Competition (WSCSC), the only multi-university sales competition in the western United States. While all members of the team – Megan Leppez, Jawwad Baig, Sharmayne Ford and Maria Araujo, who are marketing students – placed in the top three for at least one event, Leppez achieved a second-place finish overall in the contest.\\n“I think we were successful because we took it very seriously, we wanted to do our best, to leave it all in the room and bring home the win,” Leppez, who is planning to graduate in December 2014, said.\\nThe WSCSC, held at California State University, Chico, consisted of live sales scenarios, including 12-minute “role plays” and prerecorded sales presentations for Frito-Lay and TekSystems, which were judged by a panel of recruiters.\\nJuniors Ford and Baig placed second and third, respectively, for their prerecorded Frito-Lay sales pitches, while Araujo, a senior, placed third in the TakSystems role play. Baig took home additional honors for placing third in the live Frito-Lay role play.\\n“This competition is a great testament of our students’ skills,” said program director Howard Dover. “The best way to prepare students to be successful in the art of sales is to put them under pressure, which is exactly what competitions like WSCSC do.”\\nLeppez attributes tireless research and preparation, as well as solid teamwork, for the team’s win. She also credits the team’s coach, Semira Amirpour, and Dr. Dover for their training and support, helping lead the team to victory.\\n“Dr. Dover certainly laid the groundwork for all of us and made us so much more comfortable in these kinds of situations by having many opportunities to be surrounded by important people all semester long,” Leppez said.\\nMore from Rotator\\nAmerican Heart Association to Honor Associate Dean for Community Impact\\nAccounting Students Score Scholarships from the Texas Society of CPAs\\nBig Idea Competition Finals Will Put Kawasaki’s Art of Innovation on Display\\nThe iPhone X:  Will it pop or will it fizzle?\\nJindal School Alumna Earns Women in Technology Award\\nRequest Information']},\n",

Podcast\\nbyVarghese Jacob- September 23rd, 2015 -College Knowledge,Jindal News & Events,Joining JSOM\\nIn the Executive MBA programs, we offer two international trips for each cohort. (A cohort is a group of students that stays the same as they all go through a program together.) While these study abroad trips are a lot of fun, provide bonding opportunities for the cohort and allow our students to take in local tourist attractions, there are a number of academic objectives for the international study trips.\\nThe academic goals often help me, the program director, answer the first question for every study abroad program: Where do we go? Is the idea to compare and contrast an emerging market with a fully developed country, such as Malaysia and Singapore? Do I want to students to evaluate the competitive advantage of a country within in a region — for example, how does Australia compete within the eastern Asia economy? The location is keyed to the course objectives, and the location must be relevant in today’s economy.\\nDuring the executive international study trip, students begin on Sunday with cultural visits in the first city. This “soft start” allows students to take in the local sights. On Monday, we begin our company visits. The goal is to get students in front of senior leaders who will talk candidly about their company’s business strategy and competitive advantages. We frequently visit corporate partners of UT Dallas, such as Ericsson and Texas Instruments. In fact, we have visited Ericsson offices on five continents, and we hope to make it six when we visit South Africa next year.\\nSome company visits allow for manufacturing tours, where we can observe firsthand such industrial processes as how Stanley Black and Decker manufactures nails in its facility outside Beijing. Since the company can’t compete cost effectively in China, it builds superior products and sends them to the U.S. The Corning manufacturing facility outside Istanbul produces fiber cable. The company reduces costs by having no finished inventory on site — everything is made to order.\\nAfter company visits on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning, the students travel to the second city on Wednesday afternoon. More company visits follow on Thursday and Friday. Cultural visits are scheduled on Saturday, and students depart for home on Sunday morning.\\nGoing on a study abroad trip enables students to learn from business executives and ask candid questions about growth, strategy, operations, cultural differences. The company visits enable students to apply what they have learned in their MBA program directly to the companies that are visited, and they can take in the local culture, as well as bond with their classmates.\\nView all posts by Varghese Jacob\\nMore from College Knowledge - Blog Category\\nStudent Spotlight: Anthony Chu\\nAnthony Chu is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and he is expected to graduate Dec. 2026.\\nStudent Spotlight: Dena Aljabari\\nDena Aljabari is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and Analytics and she is expected to graduate May 2025.\\nStudent Spotlight: Nnamdi Edeoga\\nNnamdi Edeoga is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management and is expected to graduate in May 2025.\\n5 Reasons to Study Risk Management and Cyber Security at UT Dallas\\nAn understanding of risk management and cybersecurity can help individuals create resilient businesses that can stand the test of potential threats.\\nStudent Spotlight: Madison Hill\\nMadison Hill is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management and a Bachelor of Science in Finance double-major and she is expected to graduate May 2026.\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Over the next three years, the expansion is expected to generate nearly 4,000 new ventures and 9,000 new jobs in the Lone Star State.Blackstone’s charitable foundation allocated $1 million of the funding to UT Dallas, which matched that grant dollar for dollar, for initial total program funding of $2 million.“At Blackstone LaunchPad, we welcome students, faculty, staff and alumni — anyone who has an interest in learning about entrepreneurship,” Bryan Chambers, program director, said. “From the student that might have an idea but doesn’t know where to begin, all the way to our most-accomplished professors who are inventing new materials in their laboratories and still need entrepreneurial-level support — our programming will be able ((to accommodate the entire spectrum of needs.”So proud of Blackstone LaunchPadSteve Guengerich, IIE’s new executive director, was introduced at the Blackstone LaunchPad launch.At the dedication, leaders from UT Dallas and Blackstone expressed their pride and enthusiasm for the possibilities that the program will help engender within the walls of its new facility.

Benson, president of UT Dallas. While providing the 150 or so in attendance with a brief overview of the University’s history, he highlighted the connection between the vision of UT Dallas founders Cecil H. Green, J.

Moreover, the persistence of managers’ behaviors in downloading company insiders’ trades improves performance.”\\nThe research also has wider implications. “In the bigger picture of big data and information overload, this research is an example of what we can do to identify who is doing their job of creating risk-adjusted profits and how are they reducing the set of information overload into manageable chunks,” Gurun said.\\nGurun’s co-authors are Huaizhi Chen of Harvard Business School, Lauren Cohen and Christopher Malloy of Harvard Business School and the National Bureau of Economic Research, and Dong Lou of the London School of Economics.\\nJun Li, who earned a Crowell second-place prize in 2015 and third place in 2011 for previous research, focused on planned investments of firms and how they impact their risk premiums. Along with his co-author, Huijun Wang of the University of Delaware, Li developed a measure of investment plans called expected investment growth (EIG), and found that high EIG firms earned an annualized stock return that was 15 percent higher than low EIG firms among U.S. public firms from 1968 to 2016. Further, none of the leading asset-pricing factor models can capture this large EIG premium, Li said.\\n“Compared with firms with low EIG, firms with high EIG generate more cash flow several years into the future, indicating a strong incentive for these firms to expand their production capacity. Meanwhile, their cash flow moves more with business cycles because of their committed investment, so these firms are in fact riskier than firms with low EIG.” Li said.\\nLi believes his research is important for corporate managers as well as stock market investors. “Managers need to understand the risk associated with expansions of production capacity.” Li said. “Our findings also help to understand why past winning stocks on average outperform past losing stocks, a phenomenon in the stock market known as momentum.”\\nLi is currently in the journal submission process of his research, while Gurun and his team are looking at other business problems they can approach with their findings.\\n“Now that we know who demands what type of information there are a lot more interesting research questions to work on,” Gurun said.\\nBS FinanceMS FinanceMS Financial Engineering and Risk Management\\nView all posts by Caryn Berardi\\nMore from Corporate - News Category\\nNew Jindal School Lab Harnesses the Power of AI\\nJindal School Launches Certificate to Address Need for Sustainability Education in Aviation and Travel\\nThanks(for)giving Reception Celebrates Jindal School’s Donors\\nJindal School's Tina T.

Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- August 27th, 2020 -Students\\nDuring a global pandemic, adjusting to uncertainty and even learning how to embrace it are keys to success.\\nThat mindset drivesBrittany Brunson,Philip MillerandGaurav Sethifrom theNaveen Jindal School of Managementin their academic and professional pursuits. It also earned them each a $15,000 Mitchell Family Foundation Scholar Award from theTexas Business Hall of Fame Foundation.\\nExecutive committee members of the board of directors at the Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation had to do some adjusting of their own.\\n“We did the interviews virtually, whereas we usually would have done them in person,” saidDr. Diane McNulty, associate dean of external affairs at the Jindal School and vice-president of scholar awards and endowment for the foundation’s executive committee. “We took the pandemic into consideration when we asked the candidates about their plans.”\\nIn the end, two of the Jindal School candidates selected did not enroll this fall so that they could stay focused on their careers and keep their entrepreneurial ventures alive during the the pandemic.\\n“The ability to pivot during this unfortunate situation is one of the things that the board decided was critical for selection this year,” McNulty said. “We asked ourselves whether the candidates’ startup ideas could realistically be launched at this time. Even candidates who have successful or promising startups found themselves in a situation that is challenging at best. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.”\\nRealizing that the candidates required a serious commitment to their professional pursuits just to survive, the committee decided that students who had existing relationships with their universities would be eligible for the awards even if they did not enroll in the fall semester. Two of the three UT Dallas students are waiting until the spring semester to continue their education at JSOM. Brunson is the only Jindal School student who is currently registered and attending classes.\\nMBA Student Brings Tech Innovation to Greek Life\\n“I work for an airline — probably not the best industry to be in right now,” said Brunson, anMBAstudent who works at Southwest Airlines as an associate manager on the customer experience planning and delivery team. “Everything that we used to focus on has shifted since the pandemic, so being able to pivot really quickly to come up with new and innovative ideas within a big corporation has been an incredible thing to be a part of.”\\nBrunson is also a co-founder of Brunson Bump System, a company that developed a sorority recruitment software tool. She created the product while an undergraduate at the University of Arkansas.\\n“It basically makes the matching process much more efficient,” she said. “It helps make sure that the sorority recruiters are talking to the right individuals — making sure they have something in common and can have meaningful conversations.”\\nSororities at the University of Arkansas still use it and the company has sold the product to the University of Alabama. Brunson said she plans to continue with Southwest while pursuing the software business on the side.\\nMarketing Grad Owns Two Sports-Related Businesses\\nPhilip Miller, who graduated in May with amaster’s degree in marketing, co-ownsCrull Fitness, an elite performance training facility in Richardson. He will continue pursuit of his MBA in the spring. He also is president atPM3 Sports, a sole-proprietorship sport management company where he represents professional athletes. Both ventures have had to make adjustments since COVID-19 hit.\\n“Each day is different,” he said about the businesses he runs. “I never know what the COVID-19 studies or news are going to say — especially with sports. I’m just trying to roll with the punches.”\\nFinance Grad Brings More Healthy Food Choices to Campuses\\nGaurav Sethi, who graduated in May with a bachelor’s degree in finance and actuarial science and plans to enroll next spring in the graduate innovation and entrepreneurship program at the Jindal School, is a risk analyst at J.P. Morgan, a financial services firm. He is also CFO at CampusOven, a service that connects university employees and students with caterers who are focused on healthy eating options. He started the company while a student at UT Dallas.\\n“Eating healthy and sustainably is really difficult for most college students,” he said. “So this service is what I’m currently working on — and that’s why I’ve wanted to take a lot of the more entrepreneurship-focused classes.”\\nGaurav took the position at J.P. Morgan to learn about risk and embrace uncertainty, which he says will pay off in pursuit of his ventures. Since the pandemic hit, CampusOven has expanded to offer meals not only to students but also to employees.

Ong said she stays connected with a network of other executive coaches through JSOM’s ongoing monthly virtual coaching forums.\\n“I receive ongoing learning and exposure to coaching experts to earn continuing coaching education credits to renew my coaching license,” she said. “JSOM also invites me to their complimentary monthly virtual consulting forums so that I hear from expert consultants on strategies for success in that dimension.”\\nOng is heavily involved withICF North Texas, a professional organization for professional coaches that welcomes students into its ranks. She said she has benefitted from meeting other local JSOM alumni who are active members in this chapter.\\nMentors Make a Difference\\nWhen asked why it is critical to have a mentor who is focused on DEIB, Ong said that we learn from what we are exposed to and see in action.\\n“I remind my DEIB consulting clients, it’s not the strategy but the daily inclusive habits that we build into the culture, that allows the strategy to thrive and grow,” she said. “I use talent gardening analogies that we have to keep planting the seeds but also testing the soil and training the gardeners, too. If we can be better at spotting barriers to full inclusion or how our biases are getting in the way, we can make better decisions and change.\\nOng credits her religious faith for helping her learn “to be more grounded on how to be fully present to be still and listen.” She also remains active at UT Dallas and JSOM to give back to an academic community that she says gave so much to her. She speaks once a year at aUTD chaptermeeting ofAscend— a Pan-Asian business professional membership organization — or JSOM’sMeteor Mentoringprogram, or both. She encourages JSOM students to take advantage of their free student membership in theTexas Society of CPAsas a great way to network with her and other alumni in the accounting profession.\\n“I encourage everyone to get involved as a volunteer in the many organizations on campus and in our community that can use their time, talent, and treasure,” she said. “Additionally, I know that I always receive more than I give when I volunteer. It refuels me when I see the good that happens when we build community and connections together.”\\nView all posts by Jimmie Markham\\nMore from Alumni - News Category\\nJindal School Alumnus Creates Innovative Solution for Chronic-Pain Management\\nJindal School Alumni Reunion: More Than 700 Alumni Gather for Fun and Connections\\nDipak Jain Named as Jindal School’s Inaugural Eminent PhD Alumnus\\nA dog-eared letter dated April 7, 1982, is so important to Dr. Dipak C.

Podcast\\nbyJimmie Markham- May 10th, 2018 -Academics,Corporate,Faculty/Research,Students\\nThis spring, graduate students enrolled in The Entrepreneurial Experience (ENTP 6398/SYSM 6315), got a unique opportunity to offer AT&T their best suggestions on how to expand the company’s “internet of things” offerings in the healthcare space. The internet of things, often branded IoT, allows physical devices like sensors, appliances, traffic signals and vehicles to exchange data via hardware, software, sensors and actuators embedded in each item. In healthcare, potential IoT devices might be heart-rate and blood-pressure monitors that could connect with smartphones, which would then send abnormal readings to on-call nurses or physicians.\\nWorking on a high-level business plan, the 14 students in the entrepreneurship class made proposals on how best to use the internet of things as it relates to patient data on two fronts. The students looked at collecting, moving, storing and analyzing data securely and efficiently in the healthcare system. They also researched proactively and pre-emptively acting on that data to provide timely intervention to avoid more severe and more costly patient conditions.\\nTaught byNaveen Jindal School of Managementfaculty memberDr. Rajiv Shah, who worked in partnership with AT&T, the class was patterned after a similar one in the fall of 2016 that offered students a chance to engage with the internet of things, as it applies to Smart Cities. That experience was so rewarding for everyone involved that Shah and leadership from AT&T decided to collaborate again.\\nMobeen Khan, assistant vice president, IoT Strategy and Product Management at AT&T, said that this spring the students, drawn both from the Jindal School and theErik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, brought innovative ideas to the table. “It was a great experience working with them,” Khan said. “I am hoping some of these ideas get implemented in the market as these students go on to become leaders in different organizations.”']}}"

However, productivity in both countries has steadily increased. Top 100 U.S. universities produced 7,957 articles in the 2014-2018 reporting period, compared to 5,359 articles in the inaugural 2000-2004 period. The number of articles from Canadian universities in the Top 100 has gone from 207 articles in 2005 to 545 in 2019.\\nThe number of publications by Top 100 universities from countries outside North America has increased from 538 in 2005 to 2,489 in 2019. China has led the way by increasing from 155 articles in 2005 to 647 in 2019.\\n“Being able to analyze productivity by country is an interesting facet of the UT Dallas Top 100 Business School Research Rankings,” saidDr. Hasan Pirkul, Caruth Chair and Jindal School dean. “To see international universities gaining on American schools speaks to global competitiveness and puts us on notice to stay on our toes.”\\nIn the 2014-2018 reporting period, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania was the most productive university, as it has been since the inception of the rankings.\\nThe Leonard N. Stern Business School at New York University climbed from No. 3 to No. 2 in the Worldwide Rankings. NYU moved ahead of Harvard Business School, which had occupied the No. 2 position since the 2012 report. That year, NYU was No. 6.\\nThe Jindal School and Columbia Business School rounded out the top five in both North American and Worldwide Rankings, coming in at No. 4 and No. 5, respectively.\\nSpeaking about the latest rankings, Pirkul said he sees the UT Dallas Top 100 as a valuable benchmarking tool for business leaders and academics. He said that top academics are drawn to hubs of research productivity. “So rankings can be a valuable faculty-recruiting tool,” he said.\\n“A cycle of faculty recruitment and corporate engagement helps to strengthen a business school’s programs, which helps it produce graduates who are well-prepared to provide real value to the corporations that hire them,” he said.\\nThe Carey Business School at John Hopkins University made the biggest jump in the rankings since last year, moving from No. 100 to No. 86 in the Worldwide Rankings.\\nFrance’s INSEAD was the top school outside North America in the Worldwide Rankings, coming in at No. 6. The next school outside North America in those rankings was the University of London’s London Business School, which came in at No. 21.\\nThe United Kingdom and Canada each had six schools on the worldwide list, followed by Singapore with three. France, the Netherlands and Australia each have two schools on the list. Spain, Denmark, Italy, Germany and India each have one school in the Top 100.\\nFor a complete listing of the most recent research productivity rankings, visitThe UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings™.\\nView all posts by Jimmie Markham\\nMore from Faculty/Research - News Category\\nProfessor Milind Dawande Remembered at Jindal School Event\\nJindal School Ranks No. 6 Worldwide in FT Research Productivity Rankings\\n2025 UTD Top 100 Business School Research Rankings™\\nAdvancing Marketing Science: Key Discussions from the Jindal School’s 2025 Bass FORMS Conference\\nResearcher Honors His Father Though His Healthcare Work\\nRequest Information\\nThank you for your interest in the Naveen Jindal School of Management, UT Dallas.

Podcast\\nbyJeanne Spreier- April 4th, 2017 -Alumni,Events\\nMore than 80 University of Texas at Dallas alumni gathered at New York City’s Park Avenue Tavern in March — mostly reveling in the fact that so many UT Dallas alumni live and work in the Big Apple.\\nAbout three-quarters of the attendees to the midtown Manhattan happy hour were Naveen Jindal School of Management alumni.\\nThe most frequently heard comment was “thank you for doing this,” said Brittany Huber, JSOM director for development and alumni relations, who attended the event. “Most of them were surprised there were so many UT Dallas alums in the city. A lot of them didn’t even realize we have a full UT Dallas alumni chapter in New York City.”\\nAmong the pleasant surprises — two alumni who both work for Verizon but didn’t realize they both graduated from UT Dallas until they showed up at the venue.\\n“In New York City, people tend to look for their pack,” says Jack Sun, BS’02, CEO of Sino Garden International Development Corp., which is based in the New York-New Jersey area. “A local alumni network provides resources, connections and mutual benefits.”\\nThe New York City alumni chapter was established byMatthew Thompson, BS’12, shortly after he moved there.
